### Before submitting

Please complete the following checklist when submitting a PR:

- [ ] All new functions and code must be clearly commented and documented.

- [ ] Ensure that code is properly formatted by running `make format`.
      The latest version of black and `clang-format-20` are used in CI/CD to check formatting.

- [ ] All new features must include a unit test.
      Integration and frontend tests should be added to [`frontend/test`](../frontend/test/),
      Quantum dialect and MLIR tests should be added to [`mlir/test`](../mlir/test/), and
      Runtime tests should be added to [`runtime/tests`](../runtime/tests/).

When all the above are checked, delete everything above the dashed
line and fill in the pull request template.
