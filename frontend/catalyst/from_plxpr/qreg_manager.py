class QregManager:
    """
    A manager that handles converting plxpr wire indices into catalyst jaxpr qreg.

    The fundamental challenge in from_plxpr is that Plxpr (and frontend PennyLane) uses wire index
    semantics, but Catalyst jaxpr uses qubit value semantics.

    In plxpr, there is the notion of an implicit global state, and each operation (gates, or meta-
    ops like control flow or adjoint) is essentially an update to the global state. At any time,
    the target of an operation is the implicit global state. This is also in line with devices:
    most simulators have a global state vector, and hardware has the one piece of hardware that
    gates are applied to.

    However, in Catalyst no such global state exists. Each (pure) operation consumes an SSA qubit
    (or qreg for meta ops) value and return a new qubit (or qreg) value. The target of an operation,
    while expressed by a plain wire index in plxpr, needs to be converted to the **current**
    SSA qubit value at that index in catalyst jaxpr.

    For example, the RX operation in the snippet (pseudo code)
        qreg:AbstractQreg() = ...
        q0:AbstractQbit() = qextract qreg 0
        q1:AbstractQbit() = qinst[
           op=RX
        ] q0 3.14
    would update the current qubit value on index 0 of register qreg from q0 to q1.

    The same goes for registers. The for loop operation in this snippet (pseudo code)
        qreg0:AbstractQreg() = qalloc 3
        qreg1:AbstractQreg() = for_loop[
            body_jaxpr={ lambda ; d:i64[] e:AbstractQreg(). let
                ...
                yield:AbstractQreg() = ...
              in (yield,) }
        ] ...for_loop_args... qreg0
    would update the current qreg value for that particular allocation from qreg0 to qreg1.

    There are two places where a fresh, new qreg value (i.e. the root qreg value of a def-use
    chain) can appear in catalyst jaxpr:
    1. From a brand new allocation, i.e. the result of a qalloc primitive.
    2. From an argument of the current scope's jaxpr.

    With the above in mind, this `QregManager` class promises the following:
    1. An instance of this class will always be tied to one root qreg value.
    2. At any moment during the from_plxpr conversion:
       - `QregManager.get()` returns the current catalyst qreg SSA value for the managed
          root register on that instance;
       - `QregManager[i]` returns the current catalyst qubit SSA value for the i-th index
          on the managed root register on that instance. If none exists, a new qubit will be
          extracted.

    To achieve the above, users of this class are expected to:
    1. Initialize an instance with the qreg SSA value from a new allocation or a new block argument;
    2. Whenever a new meta-op/op is bind-ed, update the current qreg/qubit SSA value with:
       - `QubitManager.set(new_qreg_value)`
       - `QubitManager[i] = new_qubit_value`
