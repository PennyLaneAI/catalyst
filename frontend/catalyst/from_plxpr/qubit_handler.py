Qubit value managers for from_plxpr conversion.

The fundamental challenge in from_plxpr is that Plxpr (and frontend PennyLane) uses wire index
semantics, but Catalyst jaxpr uses qubit value semantics.

In plxpr, there is the notion of an implicit global state, and each operation (gates, or meta-
ops like control flow, adjoint, or subroutines) is essentially an update to the global state.
At any time, the target of an operation is the implicit global state. This is also in line with
devices: most simulators have a global state vector, and hardware has the one piece of hardware
that gates are applied to.

However, in Catalyst no such global state exists. Each (pure) operation consumes an SSA qubit
(or qreg for meta ops) value and return a new qubit (or qreg) value. The target of an operation,
while expressed by a plain wire index in plxpr, needs to be converted to the **current**
SSA qubit value at that index in catalyst jaxpr.

For example, the RX operation in the snippet (pseudo code)
    qreg:AbstractQreg() = ...
    q0:AbstractQbit() = qextract qreg 0
    q1:AbstractQbit() = qinst[
       op=RX
    ] q0 3.14
would update the current qubit value on index 0 of register qreg from q0 to q1.

The same goes for registers. The for loop operation in this snippet (pseudo code)
    qreg0:AbstractQreg() = qalloc 3
    qreg1:AbstractQreg() = for_loop[
        body_jaxpr={ lambda ; d:i64[] e:AbstractQreg(). let
            ...
            yield:AbstractQreg() = ...
          in (yield,) }
    ] ...for_loop_args... qreg0
would update the current qreg value for that particular allocation from qreg0 to qreg1.

There are two places where a fresh, new qreg value (i.e. the root qreg value of a def-use
chain) can appear in catalyst jaxpr:
1. From a brand new allocation, i.e. the result of a qalloc primitive.
2. From an argument of the current scope's jaxpr.

Importantly, registers are never explicit in plxpr. Plxpr only maintains a list of global wire
indices (integer for static, int tracer for dynamic), and all operations are explicitly targeting
the wire indices. The notion of a "register" is maintained by groups of indices in plxpr.
For example, the `qml.allocate()` would trace to the following primitive:
    b:i64[] c:i64[] d:i64[] = allocate[
        num_wires=3
        other_params=...
    ]
and the integer indices `b, c, d` are logically a register, corresponding to a catalyst qreg value.

Therefore, the two central questions we wish to answer is:
1. Given a global wire index in plxpr, which logical catalyst register does this wire belong to?
2. Given a logical catalyst register, what is its current qreg SSA value, and what are its current
   qubit SSA values on its wires?

class QubitHandler:
    """
    A Qubit handler that manages converting plxpr wire indices into catalyst jaxpr qreg or qubits,
    depending on the context.

    Args:
        qubit_or_qreg_ref: An `AbstractQreg` value, or a list/tuple of `AbstractQbit` values.

    If `qubit_or_qreg_ref` is an `AbstractQreg`, this handler manages converting the qubits in qreg.

    However, if `qubit_or_qreg_ref` is a list/tuple of `AbstractQbit` values, this handler
    manages converting the qubits in the list/tuple. This is useful when the qubits
    are passed in as arguments to the function being converted. This feature is mainly
    useful for lowering decomposition rules that take in qubits as arguments.

    In qreg mode, this manager answers the second question, i.e. given a logical catalyst register,
    what is its current qreg SSA value, and what are its current qubit SSA values on its wires?

    This `QubitHandler` class promises the following in qreg mode:
    1. An instance of this class will always be tied to one root qreg value.
    2. At any moment during the from_plxpr conversion:
       - `QubitHandler[i]` (i=0,1,2....) returns the current catalyst qubit SSA value for the i-th
          index on the managed root register on that instance. If none exists, a new qubit will be
          extracted.
       - `QubitHandler.get()` returns the current catalyst qreg SSA value for the managed
          root register on that instance;

    To achieve the above, users of this class are expected to:
    1. Initialize an instance with the qreg SSA value from a new allocation or a new block argument;
    2. Whenever a new meta-op/op is bind-ed, update the current qreg/qubit SSA value with:
       - `QubitHandler.set(new_qreg_value)`
       - `QubitHandler[i] = new_qubit_value` (i=0,1,2....)
