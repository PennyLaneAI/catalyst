# OQD Gate-Decomposition Parameters
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# A database containing parameters relating to decompositions of gates to pulse operations used in
# an Open Quantum Design (OQD) trapped-ion quantum computer device.

oqd_config_schema = "v0.1"


# Beams
# A beam contains 4 properties that will be calibrated:
#    rabi = float,
#    detuning = float,
#    polarization = int array,
#    wavevector = int array,
#
# A pulse operation will consist of a beam, a transition, a phase, a time (duration of application), and a target qubit
# A list of beams is recorded in this toml.
#
# `beams1` are the beams used for single-qubit gates.
# The i-th beams1 is usable on the i-th qubit.
#
# `beams2` are the beams used for 2-qubit gates.
# In a system with n qubits, there are (n choose 2) = n*(n-1)/2 possible two-qubit
# combinations. Each combination is represented by a unique index. For example, in a 4-qubit system, where the qubits are indexed as [0, 1, 2, 3],
# the possible two-qubit combinations and their indices are:
#   0: (0, 1)
#   1: (0, 2)
#   2: (0, 3)
#   3: (1, 2)
#   4: (1, 3)
#   5: (2, 3)
# The i-th beams2 is usable on a gate whose input qubit indices
# correspond to i in the above encoding combination.
