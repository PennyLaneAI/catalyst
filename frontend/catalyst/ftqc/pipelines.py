    """Return the pipeline stages for MBQC workloads.

    The MBQC pipeline is identical to the default Catalyst pipeline, but with

      * the MBQC-to-LLVM dialect-conversion pass inserted immediately before the Quantum-to-LLVM
        dialect-conversion pass in the ``MLIRToLLVMDialect`` pipeline stage, and
      * array-backed registers enabled via the ``use-array-backed-registers`` option of the
