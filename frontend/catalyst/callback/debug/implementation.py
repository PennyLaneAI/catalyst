    """Debug callback

    An debug callback is a python function that can write to stdout or to a file.
    It is expected to return no values.

    Using `debug.callback` allows a user to run a python function with side effects inside an
    `@qjit` context. To mark a function as a `debug.callback`, one can use a decorator:

    ```python
    @debug.callback
    def my_custom_print(x):
        print(x)

    @qjit
    def foo(x):
       my_custom_print(x)

    # Can also be used outside of a JIT compiled context.
    my_custom_print(x)
    ```

    or through a more functional syntax:

    ```python
    def my_custom_print(x):
        print(x)

    @qjit
    def foo(x):
        debug.callback(my_custom_print)(x)
    ```

    `debug.callback`s are expected to not return anything.
    May be useful for custom printing and logging into files.

    At the moment, `debug.callback`s should not be used inside gradients.
