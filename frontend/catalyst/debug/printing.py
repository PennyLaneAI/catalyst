def print(fmt, *args, **kwargs):
    """A :func:`~.qjit` compatible print function for printing values at runtime.

    This print function allows printing of values at runtime, unlike usage of standard Python
    ``print`` which will print values at program capture/compile time.

    ``debug.print`` is a minimal wrapper around :func:`~.debug.callback` which calls Python's
    ``builtins.print`` function, and thus will use the same formatting styles as Python's built-in
    print function.

    Args:
        fmt (str): The string to be printed. Note that this may also be a
            format string used to format input arguments (for example
            ``cost={x}``), similar to those permitted by ``str.format``. See
            the Python docs on
            `string formatting <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format>`__ and
            `format string syntax <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings>`__.
        **args: Arguments to be passed to the format string.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to be passed to the format string.

    .. seealso:: :func:`~.print_memref`, :func:`~.debug.callback`.

    **Example**

    >>> @qjit
    ... def f(a, b, c):
    ...     debug.print("c={c} b={b} a={a}", a=a, b=b, c=c)
    >>> f(1, 2, 3)
    c=3 b=2 a=1

    In addition to passing keyword arguments to the format string, we can also pass arguments
    positionally:

    >>> @qjit
    ... def f(x, y):
    ...     debug.print("Value of x = {0:.2f}", x)
    >>> f(0.543, 0.23)
    Value of x = 0.54

    .. note::

        Using Python f-strings as the ``fmt`` string will not work as expected since they will be
        treated as Python objects.

        This means that array values embedded in them will have their compile-time representation
        printed, instead of actual data.
