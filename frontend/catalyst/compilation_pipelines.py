        Currently, ``lightning.qubit`` is the only supported backend device
        for Catalyst compilation. For a list of supported operations, observables,
        and measurements, please see the :doc:`/dev/quick_start`.

    Args:
        fn (Callable): the quantum or classical function
        autograph (bool): Experimental support for automatically converting Python control
            flow statements to Catalyst-compatible control flow. Currently supports Python ``if``,
            ``elif``, ``else``, and ``for`` statements. Note that this feature requires an
            available TensorFlow installation. For more details, see the
            :doc:`AutoGraph guide </dev/autograph>`.
        async_qnodes (bool): Experimental support for automatically executing
            QNodes asynchronously, if supported by the device runtime.
        target (str): the compilation target
        keep_intermediate (bool): Whether or not to store the intermediate files throughout the
            compilation. If ``True``, intermediate representations are available via the
            :attr:`~.QJIT.mlir`, :attr:`~.QJIT.jaxpr`, and :attr:`~.QJIT.qir`, representing
            different stages in the optimization process.
        verbosity (bool): If ``True``, the tools and flags used by Catalyst behind the scenes are
            printed out.
        logfile (Optional[TextIOWrapper]): File object to write verbose messages to (default -
            ``sys.stderr``).
        pipelines (Optional(List[Tuple[str,List[str]]])): A list of pipelines to be executed. The
            elements of this list are named sequences of MLIR passes to be executed. A ``None``

    Returns:
        QJIT object.

    Raises:
        FileExistsError: Unable to create temporary directory
        PermissionError: Problems creating temporary directory
        OSError: Problems while creating folder for intermediate files
        AutoGraphError: Raised if there was an issue converting the given the function(s).
        ImportError: Raised if AutoGraph is turned on and TensorFlow could not be found.

    **Example**

    In just-in-time (JIT) mode, the compilation is triggered at the call site the
    first time the quantum function is executed. For example, ``circuit`` is
    compiled as early as the first call.

    .. code-block:: python

        @qjit
        @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
        def circuit(theta):
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0,1])
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=1))

    >>> circuit(0.5)  # the first call, compilation occurs here
    array(0.)
    >>> circuit(0.5)  # the precompiled quantum function is called
    array(0.)

    Alternatively, if argument type hints are provided, compilation
    can occur 'ahead of time' when the function is decorated.

    .. code-block:: python

        from jax.core import ShapedArray

        @qjit  # compilation happens at definition
        @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
        def circuit(x: complex, z: ShapedArray(shape=(3,), dtype=jnp.float64)):
            theta = jnp.abs(x)
            qml.RY(theta, wires=0)
            qml.Rot(z[0], z[1], z[2], wires=0)
            return qml.state()

    >>> circuit(0.2j, jnp.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.9]))  # calls precompiled function
    array([0.75634905-0.52801002j, 0. +0.j,
           0.35962678+0.14074839j, 0. +0.j])

    .. important::

        Most decomposition logic will be equivalent to PennyLane's decomposition.
        However, decomposition logic will differ in the following cases:

        1. All :class:`qml.Controlled <pennylane.ops.op_math.Controlled>` operations will decompose
            to :class:`qml.QubitUnitary <pennylane.QubitUnitary>` operations.

        2. :class:`qml.ControlledQubitUnitary <pennylane.ControlledQubitUnitary>` operations will
            decompose to :class:`qml.QubitUnitary <pennylane.QubitUnitary>` operations.

        3. The list of device-supported gates employed by Catalyst is currently different than that
            of the ``lightning.qubit`` device, as defined by the
            :class:`~.pennylane_extensions.QJITDevice`.

    .. details::
        :title: AutoGraph and Python control flow

        Catalyst also supports capturing imperative Python control flow in compiled programs. You
        can enable this feature via the ``autograph=True`` parameter. Note that it does come with
        some restrictions, in particular whenever global state is involved. Refer to the
        :doc:`AutoGraph guide </dev/autograph>` for a complete discussion of the
        supported and unsupported use-cases.

        .. code-block:: python

            @qjit(autograph=True)
            @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
            def circuit(x: int):

                if x < 5:
                    qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
                else:
                    qml.T(wires=0)

                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

        >>> circuit(3)
        array(0.)

        >>> circuit(5)
        array(1.)

        Note that imperative control flow will still work in Catalyst even when the AutoGraph
        feature is turned off, it just won't be captured in the compiled program and cannot involve
        traced values. The example above would then raise a tracing error, as there is no value for
        ``x`` yet than can be compared in the if statement. A loop like ``for i in range(5)`` would
        be unrolled during tracing, "copy-pasting" the body 5 times into the program rather than
        appearing as is.

    .. details::
        :title: Static arguments

        ``static_argnums`` defines which elements should be treated as static. If it takes an
        integer, it means the argument whose index is equal to the integer is static. If it takes
        an iterable of integers, arguments whose index is contained in the iterable are static.
        Changing static arguments will introduce re-compilation.

        A valid static argument must be hashable and its ``__hash__`` method must be able to
        reflect any changes of its attributes.

        .. code-block:: python

            @dataclass
            class MyClass:
                val: int

                def __hash__(self):
                    return hash(str(self))

            @qjit(static_argnums=1)
            def f(
                x: int,
                y: MyClass,
            ):
                return x + y.val

            f(1, MyClass(5))
            f(1, MyClass(6)) # re-compilation
            f(2, MyClass(5)) # no re-compilation

        In the example above, ``y`` is static. Note that the second function call triggers
        re-compilation since the input object is different from the previous one. However,
        the third function call direcly uses the previous compiled one and does not introduce
        re-compilation.

        .. code-block:: python

            @dataclass
            class MyClass:
                val: int

                def __hash__(self):
                    return hash(str(self))

            @qjit(static_argnums=(1, 2))
            def f(
                x: int,
                y: MyClass,
                z: MyClass,
            ):
                return x + y.val + z.val

            my_obj_1 = MyClass(5)
            my_obj_2 = MyClass(6)
            f(1, my_obj_1, my_obj_2)
            my_obj_1.val = 7
            f(1, my_obj_1, my_obj_2) # re-compilation

        In the example above, ``y`` and ``z`` are static. The second function should make
        function ``f`` be re-compiled because ``my_obj_1`` is changed. This requires that
        the mutation is properly reflected in the hash value.


    .. details::
        :title: Dynamically-shaped arrays

        There are three ways to use ``abstracted_axes``; by passing a sequence of tuples, a
        dictionary, or a sequence of dictionaries. Passing a sequence of tuples:

        .. code-block:: python

            abstracted_axes=((), ('n',), ('m', 'n'))

        Each tuple in the sequence corresponds to one of the arguments in the annotated
        function. Empty tuples can
        be used and correspond to parameters with statically known shapes.
        Non-empty tuples correspond to parameters with dynamically known shapes.

        In this example above,

        - the first argument will have a statically known shape,

        - the second argument has its zeroth axis have dynamic
          shape ``n``, and

        - the third argument will have its zeroth axis with dynamic shape
          ``m`` and first axis with dynamic shape ``n``.

        Passing a dictionary:

        .. code-block:: python

            abstracted_axes={0: 'n'}

        This approach allows a concise expression of the relationships
        between axes for different function arguments. In this example,
        it specifies that for all function arguments, the zeroth axis will
        have dynamic shape ``n``.

        Passing a sequence of dictionaries:

        .. code-block:: python

            abstracted_axes=({}, {0: 'n'}, {1: 'm', 0: 'n'})

        The example here is a more verbose version of the tuple example. This convention
        allows axes to be omitted from the list of abstracted axes.

        Using ``abstracted_axes`` can help avoid the cost of recompilation.
        By using ``abstracted_axes``, a more general version of the compiled function will be
        generated. This more general version is parametrized over the abstracted axes and
        allows results to be computed over tensors independently of their axes lengths.

        For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            @qjit
            def sum(arr):
                return jnp.sum(arr)

            sum(jnp.array([1]))     # Compilation happens here.
            sum(jnp.array([1, 1]))  # And here!

        The ``sum`` function would recompile each time an array of different size is passed
        as an argument.

        .. code-block:: python

            @qjit(abstracted_axes={0: "n"})
            def sum_abstracted(arr):
                return jnp.sum(arr)

            sum(jnp.array([1]))     # Compilation happens here.
            sum(jnp.array([1, 1]))  # No need to recompile.

        the ``sum_abstracted`` function would only compile once and its definition would be
        reused for subsequent function calls.
