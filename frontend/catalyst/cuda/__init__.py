    """A decorator for compiling PennyLane and JAX programs using CUDA Quantum.

    .. important::

        This feature currently only supports CUDA Quantum version 0.6.

    .. note::

        Currently, only the following devices are supported:

        * :class:`softwareq.qpp <SoftwareQQPP>`: a modern C++ statevector simulator
        * :class:`nvidia.statevec <NvidiaCuStateVec>`: The NVIDIA CuStateVec GPU simulator (with support for multi-gpu)
        * :class:`nvidia.tensornet <NvidiaCuTensorNet>`: The NVIDIA CuTensorNet GPU simulator (with support for matrix product
          state)

    Args:
        fn (Callable): the quantum or classical function to compile

    Returns:
        QJIT object.

    **Example**

    The compilation is triggered at the call site the
    when the quantum function is executed:

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("softwareq.qpp", wires=2)

        @cudaqjit
        @qml.qnode(dev)

            qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
            qml.RY(x[1], wires=1)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliY(0))

    >>> circuit(jnp.array([0.5, 1.4]))
    -0.47244976756708373

    From PennyLane, this functionality can also be accessed via

    >>> @qml.qjit(compiler="cuda_quantum")

    Note that CUDA Quantum compilation currently does not have feature parity with Catalyst
    compilation; in particular, AutoGraph, control flow, differentiation, and various measurement
    statistics (such as probabilities and variance) are not yet supported.
