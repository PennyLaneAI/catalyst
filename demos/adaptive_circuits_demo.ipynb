The cost function is defined as the expectation value of the Hamiltonian computed in the trial state. With VQE, the lowest energy state (also called the ground state) of the Hamiltonian can be computed using an iterative optimization of the cost function. In PennyLane, this optimization is performed by a classical optimizer which (in principle) leverages a quantum computer to evaluate the cost function and calculate its gradient at each optimization step.\n",

In this case, one strategy to reduce the complexity is to use <i>adaptive circuits</i>, customized for the molecule at hand and taking into account only those excitations that are found to be important. Applying VQE to this adapted circuit is called Adaptive VQE.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we've seen some of Catalyst's features, including the JIT and AOT compilers and QJIT compatible gradient and control-flow operations. It's important to remember that this compiler is still an experimental project, and there may be bugs and corner cases. That said, here are a few key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *PennyLane compatibility*: Catalyst provides support for core functionalities of PennyLane with a similar user interface. Some of the features may not be fully supported yet, but future plans include the addition of more.\n",
    "- *Comparable performance*: The Catalyst JIT/AOT compiler has the capability to convert PennyLane programs into machine code. It is projected to yield execution performance that is comparable to that of interpreted Python code, particularly when there are multiple calls of a JIT-compiled function in a program. It is important to take into consideration that the overhead of the compilation process may impact the performance of relatively small programs.\n",
    "- *Reduced memory usage*: Catalyst can also help to reduce the memory usage of PennyLane programs by eliminating the need to keep the original source code in memory."
