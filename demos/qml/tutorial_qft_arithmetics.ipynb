    "Arithmetic is a fundamental branch of mathematics that consists of the\n",
    "study of the main operations with numbers such as addition,\n",
    "multiplication, subtraction and division. Using arithmetic operations we\n",
    "can understand the world around us and solve many of our daily tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic is crucial for the implementation of any kind of algorithm in\n",
    "classical computer science, but also in quantum computing. For this\n",
    "reason, in this demo we are going to show an approach to defining\n",
    "arithmetic operations on quantum computers. The simplest and most direct\n",
    "way to achieve this goal is to use the quantum Fourier transform (QFT),\n",
    "which we will demonstrate on a basic level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we will not focus on understanding how the QFT is built, as\n",
    "we can find a great explanation in the [Xanadu Quantum\n",
    "Codebook](https://codebook.xanadu.ai/F.1). Instead, we will develop the\n",
    "intuition for how it works and how we can best take advantage of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question we have to ask ourselves is whether it makes sense to\n",
    "perform these basic operations on a quantum computer. Is the goal purely\n",
    "academic or is it really something that is needed in certain algorithms?\n",
    "Why implement in a quantum computer something that we can do with a\n",
    "calculator?\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to basic quantum computing algorithms like the\n",
    "Deustch-Jozsa or Grover\\'s algorithm, we might think that we have never\n",
    "needed to apply any arithmetic operations such as addition or\n",
    "multiplication. However, the reality is different. When we learn about\n",
    "these algorithms from an academic point of view, we work with a\n",
    "ready-made operator that we never have to worry about, the *oracle*.\n",
    "Unfortunately, in real-world situations, we will have to build this\n",
    "seemingly magical operator by hand. As an example, let\\'s imagine that\n",
    "we want to use Grover\\'s algorithm to search for [magic\n",
    "squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square). To define the\n",
    "oracle, which determines whether a solution is valid or not, we must\n",
    "perform sums over the rows and columns to check that they all have the\n",
    "same value. Therefore, to create this oracle, we will need to define a\n",
    "sum operator within the quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question we face is why we should work with the QFT at all.\n",
    "There are other procedures that could be used to perform these basic\n",
    "operations; for example, by imitating the classical algorithm. But, as\n",
    "we can see in, it has already been proven that the QFT needs fewer\n",
    "qubits to perform these operations, which is nowadays of vital\n",
    "importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will organize the demo as follows. Initially, we will talk about the\n",
    "Fourier basis to give an intuitive idea of how it works, after which we\n",
    "will address different basic arithmetic operations. Finally, we will\n",
    "move on to a practical example in which we will factor numbers using\n",
    "Grover\\'s algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "QFT representation\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the QFT to basic arithmetic operations, our objective now is to\n",
    "learn how to add, subtract and multiply numbers using quantum devices.\n",
    "As we are working with qubits, ---which, like bits, can take the values\n",
    "$0$ or $1$---we will represent the numbers in binary. For the purposes\n",
    "of this tutorial, we will assume that we are working only with integers.\n",
    "Therefore, if we have $n$ qubits, we will be able to represent the\n",
    "numbers from $0$ to $2^n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to know is PennyLane\\'s standard for encoding\n",
    "numbers in a binary format. A binary number can be represented as a\n",
    "string of 1s and 0s, which we can represent as the multi-qubit state\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vert m \\rangle = \\vert \\overline{q_0q_1...q_{n-1}}\\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the formula to obtain the equivalent decimal number $m$ will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m= \\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}2^{n-1-i}q_i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\vert m \\rangle$ refers to the basic state generated by the\n",
    "binary encoding of the number $m$. For instance, the natural number $6$\n",
    "is represented by the quantum state $\\vert 110\\rangle,$ since\n",
    "$\\vert 110 \\rangle = 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 1\\cdot 2^1+0\\cdot 2^0 = 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we would represent all the integers from $0$ to $7$ using\n",
    "the product state of three qubits, visualized by separate Bloch spheres\n",
    "for each qubit.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere) is a way\n",
    "of graphically representing the state of a qubit. At the top of the\n",

    "$\\vert 1 \\rangle$, and in the rest of the sphere we will place the\n",
    "possible states in superposition. It is a very useful representation\n",
    "that helps better visualize and interpret quantum gates such as\n",
