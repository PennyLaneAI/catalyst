# The set of all gate types supported at the runtime execution interface of the
# device, i.e., what is supported by the `execute` method of the Device API.
# The gate definition has the following format:
#
#   GATE = { properties = [ PROPS ], conditions = [ CONDS ] }
#
# where PROPS and CONS are zero or more comma separated quoted strings.
#
# PROPS: zero or more comma-separated quoted strings:
#        - "controllable": if a controlled version of this gate is supported.
#        - "invertible": if the adjoint of this operation is supported.
#        - "differentiable": if device gradient is supported for this gate.
# CONDS: zero or more comma-separated quoted strings:
#        - "analytic" or "finiteshots": if this operation is only supported in
#          either analytic execution or with shots, respectively.
#        - "terms-commute": if this composite operator is only supported
#          given that its terms commute. Only relevant for Prod, SProd, Sum,
#          LinearCombination, and Hamiltonian.
