# 'pbc' Dialect

_A dialect for Pauli-based computation and error correction._

This QEC dialect focuses on Pauli-based computation for the purposes of Surface code and related
Quantum Error Correction techniques. Pauli-product rotations (PPRs) and Pauli-product measurements
(PPMs) are represented, as well transformations on them. Error correction primitives like
magic state fabrication are also represented.

A lot of the techniques in this dialect are based on Daniel Litinski's work, including
[A Game of Surface Codes](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2019-03-05-128) and
[Active Volume](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.15465).
