# OpInterface definitions

## QECOpInterface (`QECOpInterface`)

This interface provides a generic way to interact with instructions that are
considered QEC Operations. These are characterized by operating on zero
or more qubit values, and returning the same amount of qubit values.

### Methods:

#### `getInQubits`

```c++
mlir::Operation::operand_range getInQubits();
```

Get the input qubits for this operation.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getOutQubits`

```c++
mlir::Operation::result_range getOutQubits();
```

Get the output qubits for this operation.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getPauliProduct`

```c++
::mlir::ArrayAttr getPauliProduct();
```

Get the Pauli product for this operation.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getPauliProductAttr`

```c++
::mlir::ArrayAttr getPauliProductAttr();
```

Get the Pauli product for this operation.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getRotationKind`

```c++
uint16_t getRotationKind();
```

Get the rotation kind for this operation.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setPauliProductAttr`

```c++
void setPauliProductAttr(::mlir::ArrayAttr attr);
```

Set the Pauli product for this operation.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setRotationKind`

```c++
void setRotationKind(uint16_t attrValue);
```

Set the rotation kind for this operation.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.
