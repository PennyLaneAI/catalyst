### `-commute-ppr`

_Commutate CliffordT operations to PPRotation operations._

#### Options

```
-max-pauli-size : The maximum size of the Pauli product. 0 means no limit.
```

### `-decompose-clifford-ppr`

_Decompose Clifford PPRotation operations to set of Pauli Product Measurement operations._

#### Options

```
-avoid-y-measure : Avoid Pauli-Y measurements for Clifford rotations. Rather than performing a Pauli-Y measurement for Clifford rotations (sometimes more costly), a Y state is used instead (requires Y state preparation).
```

### `-decompose-non-clifford-ppr`

_Decompose non-Clifford PPRotation operations to set of Pauli Product Measurement operations._

#### Options

```
-decompose-method : Decomposition method to use
-avoid-y-measure  : Avoid Pauli-Y measurements for Clifford rotations. Rather than performing a Pauli-Y measurement for Clifford rotations (sometimes more costly), a Y state is used instead (requires Y state preparation).
```

### `-merge-ppr-ppm`

_Absorb Clifford operations into Pauli Product Measurement operations._

#### Options

```
-max-pauli-size : The maximum size of the Pauli product. 0 means no limit.
```

### `-ppm-compilation`

_Convert CliffordT operations to Pauli Product Measurement operations._

#### Options

```
-max-pauli-size   : The maximum size of the Pauli product. 0 means no limit.
-decompose-method : Decomposition method to use
-avoid-y-measure  : Avoid Pauli-Y measurements for Clifford rotations. Rather than performing a Pauli-Y measurement for Clifford rotations (sometimes more costly), a Y state is used instead (requires Y state preparation).
```

### `-ppm-specs`

_Count specs in Pauli Product Measurement operations._

### `-to-ppr`

_Convert quantum dialects to the QEC dialect._
