# 'quantum' Dialect

_A quantum computing dialect with value semantics._

The quantum dialect extends core MLIR with the necessary types and operations to form
the core IR of the Catalyst compiler.

At a minimum, a representation of quantum programs typically contains qubit management,
quantum gate operations, and measurements. The chosen representation for this dialect is
closely aligned with the operations in the [PennyLane](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/)
quantum computing framework, but also allows for custom instruction sets.

In this dialect, quantum operations are expressed using value semantics. That is abstract
qubit values are consumed and produced by operations, instead of operations merely acting on
qubit references. This exposes the dataflow of the quantum program in the SSA graph of the
MLIR. See [QIRO: An SSA-based Quantum IR for Optimization](https://doi.org/10.1145/3491247).
