# OpInterface definitions

## DifferentiableGate (`DifferentiableGate`)

This interface provides a generic way to interact with differentiable
quantum instructions. These are quantum operations with differentiable
gate parameters (must be scalar F64 values).

### Methods:

#### `getDiffParams`

```c++
mlir::ValueRange getDiffParams();
```

Return all operands which are considered differentiable gate parameters.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getDiffOperandIdx`

```c++
size_t getDiffOperandIdx();
```

Return the starting index at which to find differentiable operands in the Operation*.Differentiable gate parameter operands do not need to be stored in a single ODS argument or be located in a particular position, but are assumed to be contiguous.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

## MeasurementProcess (`MeasurementProcess`)

This interface provides a generic way to interact with quantum measurement processes.
These are instructions that represent some information extraction procedure on the
underlying statevector. On simulators, they may be implemented by direct manipulation
of the statevector, but on hardware they typically turn into procedures over the quantum
program as a whole, usually requiring many executions of the same circuit.

### Methods:

## ParametrizedGate (`ParametrizedGate`)

This interface provides a generic way to interact with parametrized
quantum instructions. These are quantum operations with arbitrary
classical gate parameters.

### Methods:

#### `getAllParams`

```c++
mlir::ValueRange getAllParams();
```

Return all operands which are considered gate parameters.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getParamOperandIdx`

```c++
size_t getParamOperandIdx();
```

Return the starting index at which to find gate parameter operands.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

## QuantumGate (`QuantumGate`)

This interface provides a generic way to interact with instructions that are
considered 'unitary' gates, which in addition to the properties of the
"QuantumOperation" can be inverted and controlled.

### Methods:

#### `getNonCtrlQubitOperands`

```c++
mlir::ValueRange getNonCtrlQubitOperands();
```

Return operands which are considered non-controlled input qubit values.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setNonCtrlQubitOperands`

```c++
void setNonCtrlQubitOperands(mlir::ValueRange replacements);
```

Set all operands which are considered non-controlled input qubit values.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getNonCtrlQubitResults`

```c++
mlir::ResultRange getNonCtrlQubitResults();
```

Return results which are considered non-controlled output qubit values.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getCtrlQubitOperands`

```c++
mlir::ValueRange getCtrlQubitOperands();
```

Return all operands which are considered controlling input qubit values.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setCtrlQubitOperands`

```c++
void setCtrlQubitOperands(mlir::ValueRange replacements);
```

Set all operands which are considered controlling input qubit values.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getCtrlValueOperands`

```c++
mlir::ValueRange getCtrlValueOperands();
```

Return all operands which are considered controlling input boolean values.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setCtrlValueOperands`

```c++
void setCtrlValueOperands(mlir::ValueRange replacements);
```

Set all operands which are considered controlling input boolean values.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getCtrlQubitResults`

```c++
mlir::ResultRange getCtrlQubitResults();
```

Return all operands which are considered controlling output qubit values.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getAdjointFlag`

```c++
bool getAdjointFlag();
```

Return adjoint flag.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setAdjointFlag`

```c++
void setAdjointFlag(bool adjoint);
```

Set adjoint flag.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

## QuantumOperation (`QuantumOperation`)

This interface provides a generic way to interact with instructions that are
considered quantum logic gates. These are characterized by operating on zero
or more qubit values, and returning the same amount of qubit values.

### Methods:

#### `getQubitOperands`

```c++
std::vector<mlir::Value> getQubitOperands();
```

Return all operands which are considered input qubit values (including controls).

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setQubitOperands`

```c++
void setQubitOperands(mlir::ValueRange replacements);
```

Set all operands which are considered input qubit values (including controls).

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getQubitResults`

```c++
std::vector<mlir::OpResult> getQubitResults();
```

Return all results which are considered output qubit values (including controls).

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

## QuantumRegion (`QuantumRegion`)

This interface provides a generic way to interact with instructions that are
considered quantum regions. These are characterized by operating on a single
qubit register, and returning a new register value.

### Methods:

#### `getRegisterOperand`

```c++
mlir::Value getRegisterOperand();
```

Return the quantum register operand.


#### `getRegisterResult`

```c++
mlir::Value getRegisterResult();
```

Return the quantum register result.
