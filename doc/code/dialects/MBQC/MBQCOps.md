### `mbqc.measure_in_basis` (::catalyst::mbqc::MeasureInBasisOp)

_A parametric single-qubit projective measurement in an arbitrary basis._

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `mbqc.measure_in_basis` `[` $plane `,` $angle `]` $in_qubit (`postselect` $postselect^)? attr-dict `:` type(results)
```

A parametric single-qubit projective measurement is equivalent to the `quantum.measure`
operation except that it supports measurements in an arbitrary basis, rather than the
computational basis only. Specifically, the measurement basis is parameterized by a plane
along the major axes of the Bloch sphere (either XY, YZ or ZX) and a rotation angle about
that plane.

The convention we have adopted to denote the measurement plane is with a two-character
string (one of "XY", "YZ" or "ZX"), where the first character indicates the axis along which
the basis vector is aligned for a rotation angle of 0, and the second character indicates
the other axis that forms the plane. For instance, the measurement basis defined by the XY
plane with a rotation angle of 0 is the Pauli-X basis, with orthonormal basis vector |+> and
|->, which point along the +x and -x axes of the Bloch sphere, respectively. For more
details, see the documentation for the [`qml.ftqc.measure_arbitrary_basis()`
