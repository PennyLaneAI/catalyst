# 'mbqc' Dialect

_A dialect for measurement-based quantum computing._

The measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) dialect extends the Quantum dialect with
operations and passes that are useful for expressing quantum workloads in the MBQC
representation.

See for example Raussendorf et al., Measurement-based quantum computation with cluster
states, Phys. Rev. A 68, 022312 (2003),

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The MBQC dialect is experimental and and will not maintain API stability between releases.
> Use at your own risk.
