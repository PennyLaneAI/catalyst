# Release 0.8.0-dev

<h3>New features</h3>

* JAX-compatible functions that run on classical accelerators, such as GPUs, via `catalyst.accelerate` now support autodifferentiation.
  [(#920)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/920)

  For example,

  ```python
  from catalyst import qjit, grad

  @qjit
  @grad
  def f(x):
      expm = catalyst.accelerate(jax.scipy.linalg.expm)
      return jnp.sum(expm(jnp.sin(x)) ** 2)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> x = jnp.array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]])
  >>> f(x)
  Array([[2.80120452, 1.67518663],
         [1.61605839, 4.42856163]], dtype=float64)
  ```

* Assertions can now be raised at runtime via the `catalyst.debug_assert` function.
  [(#925)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/925)

  Python-based exceptions (via `raise`) and assertions (via `assert`)
  will always be evaluated at program capture time, before certain runtime information
  may be available.

  Use `debug_assert` to instead raise assertions at runtime, including
  assertions that depend on values of dynamic variables.

  For example,

  ```python
  from catalyst import debug_assert

  @qjit
  def f(x):
      debug_assert(x < 5, "x was greater than 5")
      return x * 8
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> f(4)
  Array(32, dtype=int64)
  >>> f(6)
  RuntimeError: x was greater than 5
  ```

  Assertions can be disabled globally for a qjit-compiled function
  via the ``disable_assertions`` keyword argument:

  ```python
  @qjit(disable_assertions=True)
  def g(x):
      debug_assert(x < 5, "x was greater than 5")
      return x * 8
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> g(6)
  Array(48, dtype=int64)
  ```

* A `qjit` run for `lightning.qubit` and `lightning.kokkos` can now be seeded.
  [(#936)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/936)

  The `qjit` decorator now can take in an argument `seed`, which is an unsigned 32-bit integer.
  Different `qjit` objects with the same seed (including repeated calls to the same `qjit`)
  will return the same sequence of measurement results everytime.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit(seed=37)
  def workflow():
      @qml.qnode(dev)
      def circuit():
          qml.Hadamard(0)
          m = measure(0)
          @cond(m)
          def cfun0():
              qml.Hadamard(0)
          cfun0()
          return qml.probs()
      return circuit(), circuit(), circuit(), circuit()

  @qjit(seed=37)
  def workflow_another():
      @qml.qnode(dev)
      def circuit():
          qml.Hadamard(0)
          m = measure(0)
          @cond(m)
          def cfun0():
              qml.Hadamard(0)
          cfun0()
          return qml.probs()
      return circuit(), circuit(), circuit(), circuit()

  print(workflow())
  print(workflow())
  print(workflow_another())

  >>>
  (Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([0.5, 0.5], dtype=float64))
  (Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([0.5, 0.5], dtype=float64))
  (Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([1., 0.], dtype=float64), Array([0.5, 0.5], dtype=float64))

  ```

* Exponential extrapolation is now a supported method of extrapolation when using `mitigate_with_zne`.
  [(#953)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/953)

  This new functionality fits the data from noise-scaled circuits with an exponential function,
  and returns the zero-noise value. This functionality is available through the pennylane module
  as follows
  ```py
  from pennylane.transforms import exponential_extrapolate

  catalyst.mitigate_with_zne(
      circuit, scale_factors=jax.numpy.array([1, 2, 3]), extrapolate=exponential_extrapolate
  )
  ```

* A frontend decorator can be applied to a qnode to signal a compiler pass run.
  [(#911)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/911)

  A new module, `catalyst.passes` (file `frontend/catalyst/passes.py`), is added to
  provide UI access for pass decorators. This PR adds the `cancel_inverses` decorator,
  which runs the `-removed-chained-self-inverse` mlir pass that cancels two neighbouring
  Hadamard gates.

  ```python
  from catalyst.debug import print_compilation_stage
  from catalyst.passes import cancel_inverses

  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit(keep_intermediate=True)
  def workflow():
      @cancel_inverses
      @qml.qnode(dev)
      def f(x: float):
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)
          qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
          qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
          return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

      @qml.qnode(dev)
      def g(x: float):
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)
          qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
          qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
          return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

      ff = f(1.0)
      gg = g(1.0)

      return ff, gg

  >>> workflow()
  (Array(0.54030231, dtype=float64), Array(0.54030231, dtype=float64))
  >>> print_compilation_stage(workflow, "QuantumCompilationPass")
  func.func private @f {
  ...
      %out_qubits = quantum.custom "RX"(%extracted) %1 : !quantum.bit
      %2 = quantum.namedobs %out_qubits[ PauliZ] : !quantum.obs
      %3 = quantum.expval %2 : f64
  ...
  }
  func.func private @g {
  ...
      %out_qubits = quantum.custom "RX"(%extracted) %1 : !quantum.bit
      %out_qubits_0 = quantum.custom "Hadamard"() %out_qubits : !quantum.bit
      %out_qubits_1 = quantum.custom "Hadamard"() %out_qubits_0 : !quantum.bit
      %2 = quantum.namedobs %out_qubits_1[ PauliZ] : !quantum.obs
      %3 = quantum.expval %2 : f64
  ...
  }
  ```
  
* Catalyst now supports c executable generation with `catalyst.debug.compiler_functions.compile_executable`.
  It also supports mutti-dimensional arrays as function's inputs. [(#1003)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1003)

  ```py
  import subprocess
  from catalyst.debug import compile_executable
  
  @qjit
  def f(x):
      y = x*x
      debug.print_memref(y)
      return y
  f(5)
  binary = compile_executable(f, 1)
  result = subprocess.run(binary, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
  result.stdout
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> MemRef: base@ = 0x5df35987b780 rank = 0 offset = 0 sizes = [] strides = [] data =
  25
  MemRef: base@ = 0x5df35987b780 rank = 0 offset = 0 sizes = [] strides = [] data =
  25
  ```

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Catalyst is now compatible with Enzyme `v0.0.130`
  [(#898)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/898)

* Support has been added for the `jax.numpy.argsort`
  function within qjit-compiled functions.
  [(#901)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/901)

* Autograph now supports in-place array assignments with static slices.
  [(#843)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/843)

  For example,

  ```python
  @qjit(autograph=True)
  def f(x, y):
      y[1:10:2] = x
      return y
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> f(jnp.ones(5), jnp.zeros(10))
  Array([0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1.], dtype=float64)
  ```

* Autograph now works when `qjit` is applied to a function decorated with
  `vmap`, `cond`, `for_loop` or `while_loop`. Previously, stacking the
  autograph-enabled qjit decorator directly on top of other Catalyst
  decorators would lead to errors.
  [(#835)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/835)
  [(#938)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/938)
  [(#942)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/942)

  ```python
  from catalyst import vmap, qjit

  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> x = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
  >>> qjit(vmap(circuit), autograph=True)(x)
  Array([0.99500417, 0.98006658, 0.95533649], dtype=float64)
  ```

* Verification is now performed before compilation to confirm that the measurements included in the quantum tape
  are compatible with the device.
  [(#945)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/945)
  [(#962)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/962)

* Update JAX to `v0.4.28`.
  [(#931)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/931)
  [(#995)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/995)

* Adds `catalyst.from_plxpr.from_plxpr` for converting a PennyLane variant jaxpr into a 
  Catalyst variant jaxpr.
  [(#837)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/837)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* Return values of qjit-compiled functions that were previously `numpy.ndarray` are now of type
  `jax.Array` instead. This should have minimal impact, but code that depends on the output of
  qjit-compiled function being NumPy arrays will need to be updated.
  [(#895)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/895)

* Support for TOML files in Schema 1 has been disabled.
  [(#960)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/960)

* The `mitigate_with_zne` function no longer accepts a `degree` parameter for polynomial fitting
  and instead accepts a callable to perform extrapolation. Any qjit-compatible extrapolation
  function is valid. Keyword arguments can be passed to this function using the
  `extrapolate_kwargs` keyword argument in `mitigate_with_zne`.
  [(#806)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/806)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Catalyst no longer generates a `QubitUnitary` operation during decomposition if a device doesn't
  support it. Instead, the operation that would lead to a `QubitUnitary` is either decomposed or
  raises an error.
  [(#1002)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1002)

* Catalyst now preserves output PyTrees in QNodes executed with `mcm_method="one-shot"`.
  [(#957)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/957)

  For example:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1, shots=20)
  @qml.qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev, mcm_method="one-shot")
  def func(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      m_0 = catalyst.measure(0, postselect=1)
      return {"hi": qml.expval(qml.Z(0))}
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> func(0.9)
  {'hi': Array(-1., dtype=float64)}
  ```

* Fix a bug where scatter did not work correctly with list indices.
  [(#982)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/982)

  ```python
  A = jnp.ones([3, 3]) * 2

  def update(A):
      A = A.at[[0, 1], :].set(jnp.ones([2, 3]), indices_are_sorted=True, unique_indices=True)
      return A
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> update
  [[1. 1. 1.]
   [1. 1. 1.]
   [2. 2. 2.]]
  ```

* Static arguments can now be passed through a QNode when specified
  with the `static_argnums` keyword argument.
  [(#932)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/932)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit(static_argnums=(1,))
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x, c):
      print("Inside QNode:", c)
      qml.RY(c, 0)
      qml.RX(x, 0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  When executing the qjit-compiled function above, `c` will
  be a static variable with value known at compile time:

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.5, 0.5)
  "Inside QNode: 0.5"
  Array(0.77015115, dtype=float64)
  ```

  Changing the value of `c` will result in re-compilation:

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.5, 0.8)
  "Inside QNode: 0.8"
  Array(0.61141766, dtype=float64)
  ```

* Fixes a bug where Catalyst would fail to apply quantum transforms and preserve
  QNode configuration settings when Autograph was enabled.
  [(#900)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/900)


* `pure_callback` will no longer cause a crash in the compiler if the return type
  signature is declared incorrectly and the callback function is differentiated.
  [(#916)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/916)

* AutoGraph will now correctly convert conditional statements where the condition is a non-boolean
  static value.
  [(#944)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/944)

  Internally, statically known non-boolean predicates (such as `1`) will be
  converted to `bool`:

  ```python
  @qml.qjit(autograph=True)
  def workflow(x):
      n = 1

      if n:
          y = x ** 2
      else:
          y = x

      return y
  ```

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* A page has been added to the documentation, listing devices that are
  Catalyst compatible.
  [(#966)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/966)

<h3>Internal changes</h3>

* When memrefs have no identity layout, memrefs copy operations are replaced by the linalg copy operation.
  It does not use a runtime function but instead lowers to scf and standard dialects. It also ensures
  a better compatibility with Enzyme.
  [(#917)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/917)

* llvm O2 and Enzyme passes are only run when needed (gradients presents). Async execution of QNodes triggers now triggers a
   Coroutine lowering pass.
  [(#968)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/968)

* The function `inactive_callback` was renamed `__catalyst_inactive_callback`.
  [(#899)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/899)

* The function `__catalyst_inactive_callback` has the nofree attribute.
  [(#898)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/898)

* `catalyst.dynamic_one_shot` uses `postselect_mode="pad-invalid-samples"` in favour of `interface="jax"` when processing results.
  [(#956)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/956)

* Callbacks now have nicer identifiers in their MLIR representation. The identifiers include
  the name of the Python function being called back into.
  [(#919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/919)

* Fix tracing of `SProd` operations to bring Catalyst in line with PennyLane v0.38.
  [(#935)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/935)

  After some changes in PennyLane, `Sprod.terms()` returns the terms as leaves
  instead of a tree. This means that we need to manually trace each term and
  finally multiply it with the coefficients to create a Hamiltonian.

* The function `mitigate_with_zne` accomodates a `folding` input argument for specifying the type of
  circuit folding technique to be used by the error-mitigation routine
  (only `global` value is supported to date.)
  [(#946)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/946)

* Catalyst's implementation of Lightning Kokkos plugin has been removed in favor of Lightning's one.
  [(#974)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/974)

# Release 0.7.0

<h3>New features</h3>

* Add support for accelerating classical processing via JAX with `catalyst.accelerate`.
  [(#805)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/805)

  Classical code that can be just-in-time compiled with JAX can now be seamlessly executed
  on GPUs or other accelerators with `catalyst.accelerate`, right inside of QJIT-compiled functions.

  ```python
  @accelerate(dev=jax.devices("gpu")[0])
  def classical_fn(x):
      return jnp.sin(x) ** 2

  @qjit
  def hybrid_fn(x):
      y = classical_fn(jnp.sqrt(x)) # will be executed on a GPU
      return jnp.cos(y)
  ```

  Available devices can be retrieved via
  `jax.devices()`. If not provided, the default value of
  `jax.devices()[0]` as determined by JAX will be used.

* Catalyst callback functions, such as `pure_callback`, `debug.callback`, and `debug.print`, now
  all support auto-differentiation.
  [(#706)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/706)
  [(#782)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/782)
  [(#822)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/822)
  [(#834)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/834)
  [(#882)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/882)
  [(#907)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/907)

  - When using callbacks that do not return any values, such as `catalyst.debug.callback` and
    `catalyst.debug.print`, these functions are marked as 'inactive' and do not contribute to or
    affect the derivative of the function:

    ```python
    import logging

    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    log.setLevel(logging.INFO)

    @qml.qjit
    @catalyst.grad
    def f(x):
        y = jnp.cos(x)
        catalyst.debug.print("Debug print: y = {0:.4f}", y)
        catalyst.debug.callback(lambda _: log.info("Value of y = %s", _))(y)
        return y ** 2
    ```

    ```pycon
    >>> f(0.54)
    INFO:__main__:Value of y = 0.8577086813638242
    Debug print: y = 0.8577
    array(-0.88195781)
    ```

  - Callbacks that *do* return values and may affect the qjit-compiled functions
    computation, such as `pure_callback`, may have custom derivatives manually
    registered with the Catalyst compiler in order to support differentiation.

    This can be done via the `pure_callback.fwd` and `pure_callback.bwd` methods, to specify how the
    forwards and backwards pass (the vector-Jacobian product) of the callback should be computed:

    ```python
    @catalyst.pure_callback
    def callback_fn(x) -> float:
        return np.sin(x[0]) * x[1]

    @callback_fn.fwd
    def callback_fn_fwd(x):
        # returns the evaluated function as well as residual
        # values that may be useful for the backwards pass
        return callback_fn(x), x

    @callback_fn.bwd
    def callback_fn_vjp(res, dy):
        # Accepts residuals from the forward pass, as well
        # as (one or more) cotangent vectors dy, and returns
        # a tuple of VJPs corresponding to each input parameter.

        def vjp(x, dy) -> (jax.ShapeDtypeStruct((2,), jnp.float64),):
            return (np.array([np.cos(x[0]) * dy * x[1], np.sin(x[0]) * dy]),)

        # The VJP function can also be a pure callback
        return catalyst.pure_callback(vjp)(res, dy)

    @qml.qjit
    @catalyst.grad
    def f(x):
        y = jnp.array([jnp.cos(x[0]), x[1]])
        return jnp.sin(callback_fn(y))
    ```

    ```pycon
    >>> x = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2])
    >>> f(x)
    array([-0.01071923,  0.82698717])
    ```

* Catalyst now supports the 'dynamic one shot' method for simulating circuits with mid-circuit
  measurements, which compared to other methods, may be advantageous for circuits with many
  mid-circuit measurements executed for few shots.
  [(#5617)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5617)
  [(#798)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/798)

  The dynamic one shot method evaluates dynamic circuits by executing them one shot at a time via
  `catalyst.vmap`, sampling a dynamic execution path for each shot. This method only works for a
  QNode executing with finite shots, and it requires the device to support mid-circuit measurements
  natively.

  This new mode can be specified by using the `mcm_method` argument of the QNode:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=5, shots=20)

  @qml.qjit(autograph=True)
  @qml.qnode(dev, mcm_method="one-shot")
  def circuit(x):

      for i in range(10):
          qml.RX(x, 0)
          m = catalyst.measure(0)

          if m:
              qml.RY(x ** 2, 1)

          x = jnp.sin(x)

      return qml.expval(qml.Z(1))
  ```

  Catalyst's existing method for simulating mid-circuit measurements remains
  available via `mcm_method="single-branch-statistics"`.

  When using `mcm_method="one-shot"`, the `postselect_mode` keyword argument can also
  be used to specify whether the returned result should include `shots`-number of
  postselected measurements (`"fill-shots"`), or whether results should
  include all results, including invalid postselections (`"hw_like"`):

  ```python
  @qml.qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev, mcm_method="one-shot", postselect_mode="hw-like")
  def func(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      m_0 = catalyst.measure(0, postselect=1)
      return qml.sample(wires=0)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> res = func(0.9)
  >>> res
  array([-2147483648, -2147483648,           1, -2147483648, -2147483648,
         -2147483648, -2147483648,           1, -2147483648, -2147483648,
         -2147483648, -2147483648,           1, -2147483648, -2147483648,
         -2147483648, -2147483648, -2147483648, -2147483648, -2147483648])
  >>> jnp.delete(res, jnp.where(res == np.iinfo(np.int32).min)[0])
  Array([1, 1, 1], dtype=int64)
  ```

  Note that invalid shots will not be discarded, but will be replaced by `np.iinfo(np.int32).min`.
  They will not be used for processing final results (like expectation values), but
  they will appear in the output of QNodes that return samples directly.

  For more details, see the [dynamic quantum circuit documentation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/introduction/dynamic_quantum_circuits.html).

* Catalyst now has support for returning `qml.sample(m)` where `m` is the result of a mid-circuit
  measurement.
  [(#731)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/731)

  When used with `mcm_method="one-shot"`, this will return an array with one measurement
  result for each shot:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2, shots=10)

  @qml.qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev, mcm_method="one-shot")
  def func(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      m = catalyst.measure(0)
      qml.RX(x ** 2, wires=0)
      return qml.sample(m), qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> func(0.9)
  (array([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]), array(0.4))
  ```

  In `mcm_method="single-branch-statistics"` mode, it will be equivalent to
  returning `m` directly from the quantum function --- that is, it will return
  a single boolean corresponding to the measurement in the branch selected:

  ```python
  @qml.qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev, mcm_method="single-branch-statistics")
  def func(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      m = catalyst.measure(0)
      qml.RX(x ** 2, wires=0)
      return qml.sample(m), qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> func(0.9)
  (array(False), array(0.8))
  ```

* A new function, `catalyst.value_and_grad`, returns both the result of a function and
  its gradient with a single forward and backwards pass.
  [(#804)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/804)
  [(#859)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/859)

  This can be more efficient, and reduce overall quantum executions, compared to separately
  executing the function and then computing its gradient.

  For example:

  ```py
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=3)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      qml.RX(x, wires=2)
      return qml.probs()

  @qml.qjit
  @catalyst.value_and_grad
  def cost(x):
      return jnp.sum(jnp.cos(circuit(x)))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> cost(0.543)
  (array(7.64695856), array(0.33413963))
  ```

* Autograph now supports single index JAX array assignments
  [(#717)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/717)

  When using Autograph, syntax of the form `x[i] = y` where `i` is a single integer
  will now be automatically converted to the JAX equivalent of `x = x.at(i).set(y)`:

  ```python
  @qml.qjit(autograph=True)
  def f(array):
      result = jnp.ones(array.shape, dtype=array.dtype)

      for i, x in enumerate(array):
          result[i] = result[i] + x * 3

      return result
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> f(jnp.array([-0.1, 0.12, 0.43, 0.54]))
  array([0.7 , 1.36, 2.29, 2.62])
  ```

* Catalyst now supports dynamically-shaped arrays in control-flow primitives. Arrays with dynamic
  shapes can now be used with `for_loop`, `while_loop`, and `cond` primitives.
  [(#775)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/775)
  [(#777)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/777)
  [(#830)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/830)

  ``` python
  @qjit
  def f(shape):
      a = jnp.ones([shape], dtype=float)

      @for_loop(0, 10, 2)
      def loop(i, a):
          return a + i

      return loop(a)
  ```
  ``` pycon
  >>> f(3)
  array([21., 21., 21.])
  ```

* Support has been added for disabling Autograph for specific functions.
  [(#705)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/705)
  [(#710)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/710)

  The decorator `catalyst.disable_autograph` allows one to disable Autograph
  from auto-converting specific external functions when called within a qjit-compiled
  function with `autograph=True`:

  ```python
  def approximate_e(n):
      num = 1.
      fac = 1.
      for i in range(1, n + 1):
          fac *= i
          num += 1. / fac
      return num

  @qml.qjit(autograph=True)
  def g(x: float, N: int):

      for i in range(N):
          x = x + catalyst.disable_autograph(approximate_e)(10) / x ** i

      return x
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> g(0.1, 10)
  array(4.02997319)
  ```

  Note that for Autograph to be disabled, the decorated function must be
  defined **outside** the qjit-compiled function. If it is defined within
  the qjit-compiled function, it will continue to be converted with Autograph.

  In addition, Autograph can also be disabled for all externally defined functions
  within a qjit-compiled function via the context manager syntax:

  ```python
  @qml.qjit(autograph=True)
  def g(x: float, N: int):

      for i in range(N):
          with catalyst.disable_autograph:
            x = x + approximate_e(10) / x ** i

      return x
  ```

* Support for including a list of (sub)modules to be allowlisted for autograph conversion.
  [(#725)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/725)

  Although library code is not meant to be targeted by Autograph conversion,
  it sometimes make sense to enable it for specific submodules that might
  benefit from such conversion:

  ```py
  @qjit(autograph=True, autograph_include=["excluded_module.submodule"])
  def f(x):
    return excluded_module.submodule.func(x)

  ```

  For example, this might be useful if importing functionality from PennyLane (such as
  a transform or decomposition), and would like to have Autograph capture and convert
  associated control flow.

* Controlled operations that do not have a matrix representation defined are now supported via
  applying PennyLane's decomposition.
  [(#831)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/831)

  ``` python
  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
  def circuit():
      qml.Hadamard(0)
      qml.ctrl(qml.TrotterProduct(H, time=2.4, order=2), control=[1])
      return qml.state()
  ```

* Catalyst has now officially support on Linux aarch64, with pre-built binaries
  available on PyPI; simply `pip install pennylane-catalyst` on Linux aarch64 systems.
  [(#767)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/767)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Validation is now performed for observables and operations to ensure that provided circuits
  are compatible with the devices for execution.
  [(#626)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/626)
  [(#783)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/783)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2, shots=10000)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
      qml.CRX(x, wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.var(qml.PauliZ(1))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.43)
  DifferentiableCompileError: Variance returns are forbidden in gradients
  ```

* Catalyst's adjoint and ctrl methods are now fully compatible with the PennyLane equivalent when
  applied to a single Operator. This should lead to improved compatibility with PennyLane library
  code, as well when reusing quantum functions with both Catalyst and PennyLane.
  [(#768)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/768)
  [(#771)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/771)
  [(#802)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/802)

* Controlled operations defined via specialized classes (like `Toffoli` or `ControlledQubitUnitary`)
  are now implemented as controlled versions of their base operation if the device supports it.
  In particular, `MultiControlledX` is no longer executed as a `QubitUnitary` with Lightning.
  [(#792)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/792)

* The Catalyst frontend now supports Python logging through PennyLane's `qml.logging` module.
  For more details, please see the [logging documentation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/logging.html).
  [(#660)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/660)

* Catalyst now performs a stricter validation of the wire requirements for devices. In particular,
  only integer, continuous wire labels starting at 0 are allowed.
  [(#784)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/784)

* Catalyst no longer disallows quantum circuits with 0 qubits.
  [(#784)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/784)

* Added support for `IsingZZ` as a native gate in Catalyst. Previously, the IsingZZ gate would be
  decomposed into a CNOT and RZ gates, even if a device supported it.
  [(#730)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/730)

* All decorators in Catalyst, including `vmap`, `qjit`, `mitigate_with_zne`,
  as well as gradient decorators `grad`, `jacobian`, `jvp`, and `vjp`, can now be used
  both with and without keyword arguments as a decorator without the need for
  `functools.partial`:
  [(#758)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/758)
  [(#761)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/761)
  [(#762)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/762)
  [(#763)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/763)

  ```python
  @qjit
  @grad(method="fd")
  def fn1(x):
      return x ** 2

  @qjit(autograph=True)
  @grad
  def fn2(x):
      return jnp.sin(x)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> fn1(0.43)
  array(0.8600001)
  >>> fn2(0.12)
  array(0.99280864)
  ```

* The built-in instrumentation with `detailed` output will no longer report the cumulative time for
  MLIR pipelines, since the cumulative time was being reported as just another step alongside
  individual timings for each pipeline.
  [(#772)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/772)

* Raise a better error message when no shots are specified and `qml.sample` or `qml.counts` is used.
  [(#786)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/786)

* The finite difference method for differentiation is now always allowed, even on functions with
  mid-circuit measurements, callbacks without custom derivates, or other operations that cannot
  be differentiated via traditional autodiff.
  [(#789)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/789)

* A `non_commuting_observables` flag has been added to the device TOML schema, indicating whether or
  not the device supports measuring non-commuting observables. If `false`, non-commuting
  measurements will be split into multiple executions.
  [(#821)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/821)

* The underlying PennyLane `Operation` objects for `cond`, `for_loop`, and `while_loop` can now be
  accessed directly via `body_function.operation`.
  [(#711)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/711)

  This can be beneficial when, among other things,
  writing transforms without using the queuing mechanism:

  ```python
  @qml.transform
  def my_quantum_transform(tape):
      ops = tape.operations.copy()

      @for_loop(0, 4, 1)
      def f(i, sum):
          qml.Hadamard(0)
          return sum+1

      res = f(0)
      ops.append(f.operation)   # This is now supported!

      def post_processing_fn(results):
          return results
      modified_tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops, tape.measurements)
      print(res)
      print(modified_tape.operations)
      return [modified_tape], post_processing_fn

  @qml.qjit
  @my_quantum_transform
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
  def main():
      qml.Hadamard(0)
      return qml.probs()
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> main()
  Traced<ShapedArray(int64[], weak_type=True)>with<DynamicJaxprTrace(level=2/1)>
  [Hadamard(wires=[0]), ForLoop(tapes=[[Hadamard(wires=[0])]])]
  (array([0.5, 0. , 0.5, 0. ]),)
  ```

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* Binary distributions for Linux are now based on `manylinux_2_28` instead of `manylinux_2014`.
  As a result, Catalyst will only be compatible on systems with `glibc` versions `2.28` and above
  (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 and above).
  [(#663)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/663)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Functions that have been annotated with return type
  annotations will now correctly compile with `@qjit`.
  [(#751)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/751)

* An issue in the Lightning backend for the Catalyst runtime has been fixed that would only compute
  approximate probabilities when implementing mid-circuit measurements. As a result, low shot numbers
  would lead to unexpected behaviours or projections on zero probability states.
  Probabilities for mid-circuit measurements are now always computed analytically.
  [(#801)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/801)

* The Catalyst runtime now raises an error if a qubit is accessed out of bounds from the allocated
  register.
  [(#784)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/784)

* `jax.scipy.linalg.expm` is now supported within qjit-compiled functions.
  [(#733)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/733)
  [(#752)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/752)

  This required correctly linking openblas routines necessary for `jax.scipy.linalg.expm`.
  In this bug fix, four openblas routines were newly linked and are now discoverable by
  `stablehlo.custom_call@<blas_routine>`. They are `blas_dtrsm`, `blas_ztrsm`, `lapack_dgetrf`,
  `lapack_zgetrf`.

* Fixes a bug where QNodes that contained `QubitUnitary` with a complex matrix
  would error during gradient computation.
  [(#778)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/778)

* Callbacks can now return types which can be flattened and unflattened.
  [(#812)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/812)

* `catalyst.qjit` and `catalyst.grad` now work correctly on
  functions that have been wrapped with `functools.partial`.
  [(#820)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/820)

<h3>Internal changes</h3>

* Catalyst uses the `collapse` method of Lightning simulators in `Measure` to select a state vector
  branch and normalize.
  [(#801)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/801)

* Measurement process primitives for Catalyst's JAXPR representation now have a standardized
  call signature so that `shots` and `shape` can both be provided as keyword arguments.
  [(#790)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/790)

* The `QCtrl` class in Catalyst has been renamed to `HybridCtrl`, indicating its capability
  to contain a nested scope of both quantum and classical operations.
  Using `ctrl` on a single operation will now directly dispatch to the equivalent PennyLane class.
  [(#771)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/771)

* The `Adjoint` class in Catalyst has been renamed to `HybridAdjoint`, indicating its capability
  to contain a nested scope of both quantum and classical operations.
  Using `adjoint` on a single operation will now directly dispatch to the equivalent PennyLane class.
  [(#768)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/768)
  [(#802)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/802)

* Add support to use a locally cloned PennyLane Lightning repository with the runtime.
  [(#732)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/732)

* The `qjit_device.py` and `preprocessing.py` modules have been refactored into the sub-package
  `catalyst.device`.
  [(#721)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/721)

* The `ag_autograph.py` and `autograph.py` modules have been refactored into the sub-package
  `catalyst.autograph`.
  [(#722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/722)

* Callback refactoring. This refactoring creates the classes `FlatCallable`
  and `MemrefCallable`.
  [(#742)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/742)

  The `FlatCallable` class is a `Callable` that is
  initialized by providing some parameters and kwparameters that match the
  the expected shapes that will be received at the callsite. Instead of taking
  shaped `*args` and `**kwargs`, it receives flattened arguments. The flattened
  arguments are unflattened with the shapes with which the function was
  initialized. The `FlatCallable` return values will allways be flattened
  before returning to the caller.

  The `MemrefCallable` is a subclass of `FlatCallable`. It takes a result type
  parameter during initialization that corresponds to the expected return type.
  This class is expected to be called only from the Catalyst runtime. It
  expects all arguments to be `void*` to memrefs. These `void*` are casted
  to MemrefStructDescriptors using ctypes, numpy arrays, and finally jax
  arrays. These flat jax arrays are then sent to the `FlatCallable`.
  `MemrefCallable` is again expected to be called only from within the Catalyst
  runtime. And the return values match those expected by Catalyst runtime.

  This separation allows for a better separation of concerns, provides a nicer
  interface and allows for multiple `MemrefCallable` to be defined for a single
  callback, which is necessary for custom gradient of `pure_callbacks`.

* A new `catalyst::gradient::GradientOpInterface` is available when querying the gradient method in
  the mlir c++ api.
  [(#800)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/800)

  `catalyst::gradient::GradOp`, `ValueAndGradOp`, `JVPOp`, and `VJPOp` now inherits traits in this
  new `GradientOpInterface`. The supported attributes are now `getMethod()`, `getCallee()`,
  `getDiffArgIndices()`, `getDiffArgIndicesAttr()`, `getFiniteDiffParam()`, and
  `getFiniteDiffParamAttr()`.

  - There are operations that could potentially be used as `GradOp`, `ValueAndGradOp`, `JVPOp` or
    `VJPOp`. When trying to get the gradient method, instead of doing
    ```C++
          auto gradOp = dyn_cast<GradOp>(op);
          auto jvpOp = dyn_cast<JVPOp>(op);
          auto vjpOp = dyn_cast<VJPOp>(op);

          llvm::StringRef MethodName;
          if (gradOp)
              MethodName = gradOp.getMethod();
          else if (jvpOp)
              MethodName = jvpOp.getMethod();
          else if (vjpOp)
              MethodName = vjpOp.getMethod();
    ```
    to identify which op it actually is and protect against segfaults (calling
    `nullptr.getMethod()`), in the new interface we just do
    ```C++
          auto gradOpInterface = cast<GradientOpInterface>(op);
          llvm::StringRef MethodName = gradOpInterface.getMethod();
    ```

  - Another advantage is that any concrete gradient operation object can behave like a
    `GradientOpInterface`:
    ```C++
    GradOp op; // or ValueAndGradOp op, ...
    auto foo = [](GradientOpInterface op){
      llvm::errs() << op.getCallee();
    };
    foo(op);  // this works!
    ```

  - Finally, concrete op specific methods can still be called by "reinterpret"-casting the interface
    back to a concrete op (provided the concrete op type is correct):
    ```C++
    auto foo = [](GradientOpInterface op){
      size_t numGradients = cast<ValueAndGradOp>(&op)->getGradients().size();
    };
    ValueAndGradOp op;
    foo(op);  // this works!
    ```

# Release 0.6.0

<h3>New features</h3>

* Catalyst now supports externally hosted callbacks with parameters and return values
  within qjit-compiled code. This provides the ability to insert native Python code
  into any qjit-compiled function, allowing for the capability to include subroutines
  that do not yet support qjit-compilation and enhancing the debugging experience.

  [(#686)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/686)
  [(#689)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/689)

  The following two callback functions are available:

  - `catalyst.pure_callback` supports callbacks of **pure** functions. That is, functions
    with no [side-effects](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Functions/SideEffects.html) that accept parameters and return values. However, the return
    type and shape of the function must be known in advance, and is provided as a type signature.

    ```python
    @pure_callback
    def callback_fn(x) -> float:
        # here we call non-JAX compatible code, such
        # as standard NumPy
        return np.sin(x)

    @qjit
    def fn(x):
        return jnp.cos(callback_fn(x ** 2))
    ```
    ```pycon
    >>> fn(0.654)
    array(0.9151995)
    ```

  - `catalyst.debug.callback` supports callbacks of functions with **no** return values. This makes it
    an easy entry point for debugging, for example via printing or logging at runtime.

    ```python
    @catalyst.debug.callback
    def callback_fn(y):
        print("Value of y =", y)

    @qjit
    def fn(x):
        y = jnp.sin(x)
        callback_fn(y)
        return y ** 2
    ```
    ```pycon
    >>> fn(0.54)
    Value of y = 0.5141359916531132
    array(0.26433582)
    >>> fn(1.52)
    Value of y = 0.998710143975583
    array(0.99742195)
    ```

  Note that callbacks do not currently support differentiation, and cannot be used inside
  functions that `catalyst.grad` is applied to.

* More flexible runtime printing through support for format strings.
  [(#621)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/621)

  The `catalyst.debug.print` function has been updated to support Python-like format
  strings:

  ```python
  @qjit
  def cir(a, b, c):
      debug.print("{c} {b} {a}", a=a, b=b, c=c)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> cir(1, 2, 3)
  3 2 1
  ```

  Note that previous functionality of the print function to print out memory reference information
  of variables has been moved to `catalyst.debug.print_memref`.

* Catalyst now supports QNodes that execute on [Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC)](https://www.oqc.tech/)
  superconducting hardware, via [OQC Cloud](https://docs.oqc.app).
  [(#578)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/578)
  [(#579)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/579)
  [(#691)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/691)

  To use OQC Cloud with Catalyst, simply ensure your credentials are set as environment variables,
  and load the `oqc.cloud` device to be used within your qjit-compiled workflows.

  ```python
  import os
  os.environ["OQC_EMAIL"] = "your_email"
  os.environ["OQC_PASSWORD"] = "your_password"
  os.environ["OQC_URL"] = "oqc_url"

      qml.Hadamard(0)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      qml.RX(wires=0)
      return qml.counts(wires=[0, 1])

  print(circuit(0.2))
  ```

* Catalyst now ships with an instrumentation feature allowing to explore what steps are run during
  compilation and execution, and for how long.
  [(#528)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/528)
  [(#597)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/597)

  Instrumentation can be enabled from the frontend with the `catalyst.debug.instrumentation`
  context manager:

  ```pycon
  >>> @qjit
  ... def expensive_function(a, b):
  ...     return a + b
  >>> with debug.instrumentation("session_name", detailed=False):
  ...     expensive_function(1, 2)
  [DIAGNOSTICS] Running capture                   walltime: 3.299 ms      cputime: 3.294 ms       programsize: 0 lines
  [DIAGNOSTICS] Running generate_ir               walltime: 4.228 ms      cputime: 4.225 ms       programsize: 14 lines
  [DIAGNOSTICS] Running compile                   walltime: 57.182 ms     cputime: 12.109 ms      programsize: 121 lines
  [DIAGNOSTICS] Running run                       walltime: 1.075 ms      cputime: 1.072 ms
  ```

  The results will be appended to the provided file if the `filename` attribute is set, and printed
  to the console otherwise. The flag `detailed` determines whether individual steps in the compiler
  and runtime are instrumented, or whether only high-level steps like "program capture" and
  "compilation" are reported.

  Measurements currently include wall time, CPU time, and (intermediate) program size.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* AutoGraph now supports return statements inside conditionals in qjit-compiled
  functions.
  [(#583)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/583)

  For example, the following pattern is now supported, as long as
  all return values have the same type:

  ```python
  @qjit(autograph=True)
  def fn(x):
      if x > 0:
          return jnp.sin(x)
      return jnp.cos(x)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> fn(0.1)
  array(0.09983342)
  >>> fn(-0.1)
  array(0.99500417)
  ```

  This support extends to quantum circuits:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit(autograph=True)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def f(x: float):
    qml.RX(x, wires=0)

    m = catalyst.measure(0)

    if not m:
        return m, qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    qml.RX(x ** 2, wires=0)

    return m, qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> f(1.4)
  (array(False), array(1.))
  >>> f(1.4)
  (array(True), array(0.37945176))
  ```

  Note that returning results with different types or shapes within the same function, such as
  different observables or differently shaped arrays, is not possible.

* Errors are now raised at compile time if the gradient of an unsupported function
  is requested.
  [(#204)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/204)

  At the moment, `CompileError` exceptions will be raised if at compile time it is found that code
  reachable from the gradient operation contains either a mid-circuit measurement, a callback, or a
  JAX-style custom call (which happens through the mitigation operation as well as certain JAX operations).

* Catalyst now supports devices built from the
  [new PennyLane device API](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.devices.Device.html).
  [(#565)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/565)
  [(#598)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/598)
  [(#599)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/599)
  [(#636)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/636)
  [(#638)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/638)
  [(#664)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/664)
  [(#687)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/687)

  When using the new device API, Catalyst will discard the preprocessing from the original device,
  replacing it with Catalyst-specific preprocessing based on the TOML file provided by the device.
  Catalyst also requires that provided devices specify their wires upfront.

* A new compiler optimization that removes redundant chains of self inverse operations has been
  added. This is done within a new MLIR pass called `remove-chained-self-inverse`. Currently we
  only match redundant Hadamard operations, but the list of supported operations can be expanded.
  [(#630)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/630)

* The `catalyst.measure` operation is now more lenient in the accepted type for the `wires` parameter.
  In addition to a scalar, a 1D array is also accepted as long as it only contains one element.
  [(#623)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/623)

  For example, the following is now supported:

  ```python
  catalyst.measure(wires=jnp.array([0]))
  ```

* The compilation & execution of `@qjit` compiled functions can now be aborted using an interrupt
  signal (SIGINT). This includes using `CTRL-C` from a command line and the `Interrupt` button in
  a Jupyter Notebook.
  [(#642)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/642)

* The Catalyst Amazon Braket support has been updated to work with the latest version of the
  Amazon Braket PennyLane plugin (v1.25.0) and Amazon Braket Python SDK (v1.73.3)
  [(#620)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/620)
  [(#672)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/672)
  [(#673)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/673)

  Note that with this update, all declared qubits in a submitted program will always be measured, even if specific qubits were never used.

* An updated quantum device specification format, TOML schema v2, is now supported by Catalyst. This
  allows device authors to specify properties such as native quantum control
  support, gate invertibility, and differentiability on a per-operation level.
  [(#554)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/554)

  For more details on the new TOML schema, please refer to the
  [custom devices documentation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/latest/dev/custom_devices.html).

* An exception is now raised when OpenBLAS cannot be found by Catalyst during compilation.
  [(#643)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/643)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* `qml.sample` and `qml.counts` now produce integer arrays for the sample array and basis state
  array when used without observables.
  [(#648)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/648)

* The endianness of counts in Catalyst now matches the convention of PennyLane.
  [(#601)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/601)

* `catalyst.debug.print` no longer supports the `memref` keyword argument.
  Please use `catalyst.debug.print_memref` instead.
  [(#621)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/621)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* The QNode argument `diff_method=None` is now supported for QNodes within a qjit-compiled function.
  [(#658)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/658)

* A bug has been fixed where the C++ compiler driver was incorrectly being triggered twice.
  [(#594)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/594)

* Programs with `jnp.reshape` no longer fail.
  [(#592)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/592)

* A bug in the quantum adjoint routine in the compiler has been fixed, which didn't take into
  account control wires on operations in all instances.
  [(#591)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/591)

* A bug in the test suite causing stochastic autograph test failures has been fixed.
  [(#652)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/652)

* Running Catalyst tests should no longer raise `ResourceWarning` from the use of `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`.
  [(#676)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/676)

* Raises an exception if the user has an incompatible CUDA Quantum version installed.
  [(#707)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/707)

<h3>Internal changes</h3>

* The deprecated `@qfunc` decorator, in use mainly by the LIT test suite, has been removed.
  [(#679)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/679)

* Catalyst now publishes a revision string under `catalyst.__revision__`, in addition
  to the existing `catalyst.__version__` string.
  The revision contains the Git commit hash of the repository at the time of packaging,
  or for editable installations the active commit hash at the time of package import.
  [(#560)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/560)

* The Python interpreter is now a shared resource across the runtime.
  [(#615)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/615)

  This change allows any part of the runtime to start executing Python code through pybind.

# Release 0.5.0

<h3>New features</h3>

* Catalyst now provides a QJIT compatible `catalyst.vmap`
  function, which makes it even easier to modify functions to map over inputs
  with additional batch dimensions.
  [(#497)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/497)
  [(#569)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/569)

  When working with tensor/array frameworks in Python, it can be important to ensure that code is
  written to minimize usage of Python for loops (which can be slow and inefficient), and instead
  push as much of the computation through to the array manipulation library, by taking advantage of
  extra batch dimensions.

  For example, consider the following QNode:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x, y):
      qml.RX(jnp.pi * x[0] + y, wires=0)
      qml.RY(x[1] ** 2, wires=0)
      qml.RX(x[1] * x[2], wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(jnp.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]), jnp.pi)
  Array(-0.93005586, dtype=float64)
  ```

  We can use `catalyst.vmap` to introduce additional batch dimensions to our input arguments,
  without needing to use a Python for loop:

  ```pycon
  >>> x = jnp.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
  ...                [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
  ...                [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]])
  >>> y = jnp.array([jnp.pi, jnp.pi / 2, jnp.pi / 4])
  >>> qjit(vmap(cost))(x, y)
  array([-0.93005586, -0.97165424, -0.6987465 ])
  ```

  `catalyst.vmap()` has been implemented to match the same behaviour of `jax.vmap`, so should be a drop-in
  replacement in most cases. Under-the-hood, it is automatically inserting Catalyst-compatible for loops,
  which will be compiled and executed outside of Python for increased performance.

* Catalyst now supports compiling and executing QJIT-compiled QNodes using the
  CUDA Quantum compiler toolchain.
  [(#477)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/477)
  [(#536)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/536)
  [(#547)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/547)

  Simply import the CUDA Quantum `@cudaqjit` decorator to use this functionality:

  ```python
  from catalyst.cuda import cudaqjit
  ```

  Or, if using Catalyst from PennyLane, simply specify `@qml.qjit(compiler="cuda_quantum")`.

  The following devices are available when compiling with CUDA Quantum:

  * `softwareq.qpp`: a modern C++ state-vector simulator
  * `nvidia.custatevec`: The NVIDIA CuStateVec GPU simulator (with support for multi-gpu)
  * `nvidia.cutensornet`: The NVIDIA CuTensorNet GPU simulator (with support for matrix product state)

  For example:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("softwareq.qpp", wires=2)

  @cudaqjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(x[1], wires=1)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliY(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(jnp.array([0.5, 1.4]))
  -0.47244976756708373
  ```

  Note that CUDA Quantum compilation currently does not have feature parity with Catalyst
  compilation; in particular, AutoGraph, control flow, differentiation, and various measurement
  statistics (such as probabilities and variance) are not yet supported.
  Classical code support is also limited.

* Catalyst now supports just-in-time compilation of static (compile-time constant) arguments.
  [(#476)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/476)
  [(#550)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/550)

  The `@qjit` decorator takes a new argument `static_argnums`, which specifies positional
  arguments of the decorated function should be treated as compile-time static arguments.

  This allows any hashable Python object to be passed to the function during compilation;
  the function will only be re-compiled if the hash value of the static arguments change.
  Otherwise, re-using previous static argument values will result in no re-compilation.

  ```python
  @qjit(static_argnums=(1,))
  def f(x, y):
      print(f"Compiling with y={y}")
      return x + y
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> f(0.5, 0.3)
  Compiling with y=0.3
  array(0.8)
  >>> f(0.1, 0.3)  # no re-compilation occurs
  array(0.4)
  >>> f(0.1, 0.4)  # y changes, re-compilation
  Compiling with y=0.4
  array(0.5)
  ```

  This functionality can be used to support passing arbitrary Python objects to QJIT-compiled
  functions, as long as they are hashable:

  ```py
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  @dataclass
  class MyClass:
      val: int

      def __hash__(self):
          return hash(str(self))

  @qjit(static_argnums=(1,))
  def f(x: int, y: MyClass):
      return x + y.val
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> f(1, MyClass(5))
  array(6)
  >>> f(1, MyClass(6))  # re-compilation
  array(7)
  >>> f(2, MyClass(5))  # no re-compilation
  array(7)
  ```

* Mid-circuit measurements now support post-selection and qubit reset when used with
  the Lightning simulators.
  [(#491)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/491)
  [(#507)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/507)

  To specify post-selection, simply pass the `postselect` argument to the `catalyst.measure`
  function:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def f():
      qml.Hadamard(0)
      m = measure(0, postselect=1)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  Likewise, to reset a wire after mid-circuit measurement, simply specify `reset=True`:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def f():
      qml.Hadamard(0)
      m = measure(0, reset=True)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Catalyst now supports Python 3.12
  [(#532)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/532)

* The JAX version used by Catalyst has been updated to `v0.4.23`.
  [(#428)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/428)

* Catalyst now supports the `qml.GlobalPhase` operation.
  [(#563)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/563)

* Native support for `qml.PSWAP` and `qml.ISWAP` gates on Amazon Braket devices has been added.
  [(#458)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/458)

  Specifically, a circuit like

  ```py
  dev = qml.device("braket.local.qubit", wires=2, shots=100)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def f(x: float):
      qml.Hadamard(0)
      qml.PSWAP(x, wires=[0, 1])
      qml.ISWAP(wires=[1, 0])
      return qml.probs()
  ```

* Add support for `GlobalPhase` gate in the runtime.
  [(#563)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/563)

  would no longer decompose the `PSWAP` and `ISWAP` gates.

* The `qml.BlockEncode` operator is now supported with Catalyst.
  [(#483)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/483)

* Catalyst no longer relies on a TensorFlow installation for its AutoGraph functionality. Instead,
  the standalone `diastatic-malt` package is used and automatically installed as a dependency.
  [(#401)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/401)

* The `@qjit` decorator will remember previously compiled functions when the PyTree metadata
  of arguments changes, in addition to also remembering compiled functions when static
  arguments change.
  [(#522)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/531)

  The following example will no longer trigger a third compilation:
  ```py
  @qjit
  def func(x):
      print("compiling")
      return x
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> func([1,]);             # list
  compiling
  >>> func((2,));             # tuple
  compiling
  >>> func([3,]);             # list
  ```

  Note however that in order to keep overheads low, changing the argument *type* or *shape* (in a
  promotion incompatible way) may override a previously stored function (with identical PyTree
  metadata and static argument values):

  ```py
  @qjit
  def func(x):
      print("compiling")
      return x
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> func(jnp.array(1));     # scalar
  compiling
  >>> func(jnp.array([2.]));  # 1-D array
  compiling
  >>> func(jnp.array(3));     # scalar
  compiling
  ```

* Catalyst gradient functions (`grad`, `jacobian`, `vjp`, and `jvp`) now support
  being applied to functions that use (nested) container
  types as inputs and outputs. This includes lists and dictionaries, as well
  as any data structure implementing the [PyTree protocol](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html).
  [(#500)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/500)
  [(#501)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/501)
  [(#508)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/508)
  [(#549)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/549)

  ```py
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(phi, psi):
      qml.RY(phi, wires=0)
      qml.RX(psi, wires=0)
      return [{"expval0": qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))}, qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))]

  psi = 0.1
  phi = 0.2
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> qjit(jacobian(circuit, argnum=[0, 1]))(psi, phi)
  [{'expval0': (array(-0.0978434), array(-0.19767681))}, (array(-0.0978434), array(-0.19767681))]
  ```

* Support has been added for linear algebra functions which depend on computing the eigenvalues
  of symmetric matrices, such as `np.sqrt_matrix()`.
  [(#488)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/488)

  For example, you can compile `qml.math.sqrt_matrix`:

  ```python
  @qml.qjit
  def workflow(A):
      B = qml.math.sqrt_matrix(A)
      return B @ A
  ```

  Internally, this involves support for lowering the eigenvectors/values computation lapack method
  `lapack_dsyevd` via `stablehlo.custom_call`.

* Additional debugging functions are now available in the `catalyst.debug` directory.
  [(#529)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/529)
  [(#522)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/531)

  This includes:

  - `filter_static_args(args, static_argnums)` to remove static values from arguments using the
    provided index list.

  - `get_cmain(fn, *args)` to return a C program that calls a jitted function with the provided
    arguments.

  - `print_compilation_stage(fn, stage)` to print one of the recorded compilation stages for a
    JIT-compiled function.

  For more details, please see the `catalyst.debug` documentation.

* Remove redundant copies of TOML files for `lightning.kokkos` and `lightning.qubit`.
  [(#472)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/472)

  `lightning.kokkos` and `lightning.qubit` now ship with their own TOML file. As such, we use the TOML file provided by them.

* Capturing quantum circuits with many gates prior to compilation is now quadratically faster (up to
  a factor), by removing `qextract_p` and `qinst_p` from forced-order primitives.
  [(#469)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/469)

* Update `AllocateQubit` and `AllocateQubits` in `LightningKokkosSimulator` to preserve
  the current state-vector before qubit re-allocations in the runtime dynamic qubits management.
  [(#479)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/479)

* The [PennyLane custom compiler entry point name convention has changed](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5140), necessitating
  a change to the Catalyst entry points.
  [(#493)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/493)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* Catalyst gradient functions now match the Jax convention for the returned axes of
  gradients, Jacobians, VJPs, and JVPs. As a result, the returned tensor shape from various
  Catalyst gradient functions may differ compared to previous versions of Catalyst.
  [(#500)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/500)
  [(#501)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/501)
  [(#508)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/508)

* The Catalyst Python frontend has been partially refactored. The impact on user-facing
  functionality is minimal, but the location of certain classes and methods used by the package
  may have changed.
  [(#529)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/529)
  [(#522)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/531)

  The following changes have been made:

  * Some debug methods and features on the QJIT class have been turned into free functions and moved
    to the `catalyst.debug` module, which will now appear in the public documention. This includes
    compiling a program from IR, obtaining a C program to invoke a compiled function from, and
    printing fine-grained MLIR compilation stages.

  * The `compilation_pipelines.py` module has been renamed to `jit.py`, and certain functionality
    has been moved out (see following items).

  * A new module `compiled_functions.py` now manages low-level access to compiled functions.

  * A new module `tracing/type_signatures.py` handles functionality related managing arguments
    and type signatures during the tracing process.

  * The `contexts.py` module has been moved from `utils` to the new `tracing` sub-module.

<h3>Internal changes</h3>

* Changes to the runtime QIR API and dependencies, to avoid symbol conflicts
  with other libraries that utilize QIR.
  [(#464)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/464)
  [(#470)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/470)

  The existing Catalyst runtime implements QIR as a library that can be linked against a QIR module.
  This works great when Catalyst is the only implementor of QIR, however it may generate
  symbol conflicts when used alongside other QIR implementations.

  To avoid this, two changes were necessary:

  * The Catalyst runtime now has a different API from QIR instructions.

    The runtime has been modified such that QIR instructions are lowered to functions where
    the `__quantum__` part of the function name is replaced with `__catalyst__`. This prevents
    the possibility of symbol conflicts with other libraries that implement QIR as a library.

  * The Catalyst runtime no longer depends on QIR runner's stdlib.

    We no longer depend nor link against QIR runner's stdlib. By linking against QIR runner's stdlib,
    some definitions persisted that may be different than ones used by third party implementors. To
    prevent symbol conflicts QIR runner's stdlib was removed and is no longer linked against. As a
    result, the following functions are now defined and implemented in Catalyst's runtime:

    * `int64_t __catalyst__rt__array_get_size_1d(QirArray *)`
    * `int8_t *__catalyst__rt__array_get_element_ptr_1d(QirArray *, int64_t)`

    and the following functions were removed since the frontend does not generate them

    * `QirString *__catalyst__rt__qubit_to_string(QUBIT *)`
    * `QirString *__catalyst__rt__result_to_string(RESULT *)`

* Fix an issue when no qubit number was specified for the `qinst` primitive. The primitive now
  correctly deduces the number of qubits when no gate parameters are present. This change is not
  user facing.
  [(#496)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/496)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixed a bug where differentiation of sliced arrays would result in an error.
  [(#552)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/552)

  ```py
  def f(x):
    return jax.numpy.sum(x[::2])

  x = jax.numpy.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> catalyst.qjit(catalyst.grad(f))(x)
  [1. 0. 1. 0.]
  ```

* Fixed a bug where quantum control applied to a subcircuit was not correctly mapping wires,
  and the wires in the nested region remained unchanged.
  [(#555)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/555)

* Catalyst will no longer print a warning that recompilation is triggered when a `@qjit` decorated
  function with no arguments is invoke without having been compiled first, for example via the use
  of `target="mlir"`.
  [(#522)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/531)

* Fixes a bug in the configuration of dynamic shaped arrays that would cause certain program to
  error with `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable ShapedArray object`.
  [(#526)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/526)

  This is fixed by replacing the code which updates the `JAX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES` option with a
  `transient_jax_config()` context manager which temporarily sets the value of
  `JAX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES` to True and then restores the original configuration value following the
  yield. The context manager is used by `trace_to_jaxpr()` and `lower_jaxpr_to_mlir()`.

* Exceptions encountered in the runtime when using the `@qjit` option `async_qnodes=Tue`
  will now be properly propagated to the frontend.
  [(#447)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/447)
  [(#510)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/510)

  This is done by:
  * changeing `llvm.call` to `llvm.invoke`
  * setting async runtime tokens and values to be errors
  * deallocating live tokens and values

* Fixes a bug when computing gradients with the indexing/slicing,
  by fixing the scatter operation lowering when `updatedWindowsDim` is empty.
  [(#475)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/475)

* Fix the issue in `LightningKokkos::AllocateQubits` with allocating too many qubit IDs on
  qubit re-allocation.
  [(#473)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/473)

* Fixed an issue where wires was incorrectly set as `<Wires = [<WiresEnum.AnyWires: -1>]>`
  when using `catalyst.adjoint` and `catalyst.ctrl`, by adding a `wires` property to
  these operations.
  [(#480)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/480)

* Fix the issue with multiple lapack symbol definitions in the compiled program by updating
  the `stablehlo.custom_call` conversion pass.
  [(#488)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/488)

# Release 0.4.1

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Catalyst wheels are now packaged with OpenMP and ZStd, which avoids installing additional
  requirements separately in order to use pre-packaged Catalyst binaries.
  [(#457)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/457)
  [(#478)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/478)

  Note that OpenMP support for the `lightning.kokkos` backend has been disabled on macOS x86_64, due
  to memory issues in the computation of Lightning's adjoint-jacobian in the presence of multiple
  OMP threads.

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Resolve an infinite recursion in the decomposition of the `Controlled`
  operator whenever computing a Unitary matrix for the operator fails.
  [(#468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/468)

* Resolve a failure to generate gradient code for specific input circuits.
  [(#439)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/439)

  In this case, `jnp.mod`
  was used to compute wire values in a for loop, which prevented the gradient
  architecture from fully separating quantum and classical code. The following
  program is now supported:
  ```py
  @qjit
  @grad
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def f(x):
      def cnot_loop(j):
          qml.CNOT(wires=[j, jnp.mod((j + 1), 4)])

      for_loop(0, 4, 1)(cnot_loop)()

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

* Resolve unpredictable behaviour when importing libraries that share Catalyst's LLVM dependency
  (e.g. TensorFlow). In some cases, both packages exporting the same symbols from their shared
  libraries can lead to process crashes and other unpredictable behaviour, since the wrong functions
  can be called if both libraries are loaded in the current process.
  The fix involves building shared libraries with hidden (macOS) or protected (linux) symbol
  visibility by default, exporting only what is necessary.
  [(#465)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/465)

* Resolve a failure to find the SciPy OpenBLAS library when running Catalyst,
  due to a different SciPy version being used to build Catalyst than to run it.
  [(#471)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/471)

* Resolve a memory leak in the runtime stemming from  missing calls to device destructors
  at the end of programs.
  [(#446)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/446)

# Release 0.4.0

<h3>New features</h3>

* Catalyst is now accessible directly within the PennyLane user interface,
  once Catalyst is installed, allowing easy access to Catalyst just-in-time
  functionality.

  Through the use of the `qml.qjit` decorator, entire workflows can be JIT
  compiled down to a machine binary on first-function execution, including both quantum
  and classical processing. Subsequent calls to the compiled function will execute
  the previously-compiled binary, resulting in significant performance improvements.

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(theta):
      qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
      qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=1))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.5)  # the first call, compilation occurs here
  array(0.)
  >>> circuit(0.5)  # the precompiled quantum function is called
  array(0.)
  ```

  Currently, PennyLane supports the [Catalyst hybrid compiler](https://github.com/pennylaneai/catalyst)
  with the `qml.qjit` decorator, which directly aliases Catalyst's `catalyst.qjit`.

  In addition to the above `qml.qjit` integration, the following native PennyLane functions can now
  be used with the `qjit` decorator: `qml.adjoint`, `qml.ctrl`, `qml.grad`, `qml.jacobian`,
  `qml.vjp`, `qml.jvp`, and `qml.adjoint`, `qml.while_loop`, `qml.for_loop`, `qml.cond`. These will
  alias to the corresponding Catalyst functions when used within a `qjit` context.

  For more details on these functions, please refer to the
 [PennyLane compiler documentation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/compiling_workflows.html) and
 [compiler module documentation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/qml_compiler.html).

* Just-in-time compiled functions now support asynchronuous execution of QNodes.
  [(#374)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/374)
  [(#381)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/381)
  [(#420)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/420)
  [(#424)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/424)
  [(#433)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/433)

  Simply specify `async_qnodes=True` when using the `@qjit` decorator to enable the async
  execution of QNodes. Currently, asynchronous execution is only supported by
  `lightning.qubit` and `lightning.kokkos`.

  Asynchronous execution will be most beneficial for just-in-time compiled functions that
  contain --- or generate --- multiple QNodes.

  For example,

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qnode(device=dev)
  def circuit(params):
      qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(params[1], wires=1)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=0))

  @qjit(async_qnodes=True)
  def multiple_qnodes(params):
      x = jnp.sin(params)
      y = jnp.cos(params)
      z = jnp.array([circuit(x), circuit(y)]) # will be executed in parallel
      return circuit(z)
  ```
  ``` pycon
  >>> func(jnp.array([1.0, 2.0]))
  1.0
  ```

  Here, the first two circuit executions will occur in parallel across multiple threads,
  as their execution can occur indepdently.

* Preliminary support for PennyLane transforms has been added.
  [(#280)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/280)

  ```python
  @qjit
  @qml.transforms.split_non_commuting
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(x,wires=0)
      return [qml.expval(qml.PauliY(0)), qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))]
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.4)
  [array(-0.51413599), array(0.85770868)]
  ```

  Currently, most PennyLane transforms will work with Catalyst
  as long as:

  - The circuit does not include any Catalyst-specific features, such
    as Catalyst control flow or measurement,

  - The QNode returns only lists of measurement processes,

  - AutoGraph is disabled, and

  - The transformation does not require or depend on the numeric value of
    dynamic variables.

* Catalyst now supports just-in-time compilation of dynamically-shaped arrays.
  [(#366)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/366)
  [(#386)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/385)
  [(#390)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/390)
  [(#411)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/411)

  The `@qjit` decorator can now be used to compile functions that accepts or contain tensors
  whose dimensions are not known at compile time; runtime execution with different shapes
  is supported without recompilation.

  In addition, standard tensor initialization functions `jax.numpy.ones`, `jnp.zeros`, and
  `jnp.empty` now accept dynamic variables (where the value is only known at
  runtime).

  ``` python
  @qjit
  def func(size: int):
      return jax.numpy.ones([size, size], dtype=float)
  ```

  ``` pycon
  >>> func(3)
  [[1. 1. 1.]
   [1. 1. 1.]
   [1. 1. 1.]]
  ```

  When passing tensors as arguments to compiled functions, the
  `abstracted_axes` keyword argument to the `@qjit` decorator can be used to specify
  which axes of the input arguments should be treated as abstract (and thus
  avoid recompilation).

  For example, without specifying `abstracted_axes`, the following `sum` function
  would recompile each time an array of different size is passed
  as an argument:

  ```pycon
  >>> @qjit
  >>> def sum_fn(x):
  >>>     return jnp.sum(x)
  >>> sum_fn(jnp.array([1]))     # Compilation happens here.
  >>> sum_fn(jnp.array([1, 1]))  # And here!
  ```

  By passing `abstracted_axes`, we can specify that the first axes
  of the first argument is to be treated as dynamic during initial compilation:

  ```pycon
  >>> @qjit(abstracted_axes={0: "n"})
  >>> def sum_fn(x):
  >>>     return jnp.sum(x)
  >>> sum_fn(jnp.array([1]))     # Compilation happens here.
  >>> sum_fn(jnp.array([1, 1]))  # No need to recompile.
  ```

  Note that support for dynamic arrays in control-flow primitives (such as loops),
  is not yet supported.

* Error mitigation using the zero-noise extrapolation method is now available through the
  `catalyst.mitigate_with_zne` transform.
  [(#324)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/324)
  [(#414)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/414)

  For example, given a noisy device (such as noisy hardware available through Amazon Braket):

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("noisy.device", wires=2)

  @qml.qnode(device=dev)
  def circuit(x, n):

      @for_loop(0, n, 1)
      def loop_rx(i):
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)

      loop_rx()

      qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
      qml.RZ(x, wires=0)
      loop_rx()
      qml.RZ(x, wires=0)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 0])
      qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliY(wires=0))

  @qjit
  def mitigated_circuit(args, n):
      s = jax.numpy.array([1, 2, 3])
      return mitigate_with_zne(circuit, scale_factors=s)(args, n)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> mitigated_circuit(0.2, 5)
  0.5655341100116512
  ```

  In addition, a mitigation dialect has been added to the MLIR layer of Catalyst.
  It contains a Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) operation,
  with a lowering to a global folded circuit.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The three backend devices provided with Catalyst, `lightning.qubit`, `lightning.kokkos`, and
  `braket.aws`, are now dynamically loaded at runtime.
  [(#343)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/343)
  [(#400)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/400)

  This takes advantage of the new backend plugin system provided in Catalyst v0.3.2,
  and allows the devices to be packaged separately from the runtime CAPI. Provided backend
  devices are now loaded at runtime, instead of being linked at compile time.

  For more details on the backend plugin system, see the
  [custom devices documentation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/dev/custom_devices.html).

* Finite-shot measurement statistics (`expval`, `var`, and `probs`) are now supported
  for the `lightning.qubit` and `lightning.kokkos` devices. Previously, exact statistics
  were returned even when finite shots were specified.
  [(#392)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/392)
  [(#410)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/410)

  ```pycon
  >>> dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2, shots=100)
  >>> @qjit
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
  >>> def circuit(x):
  >>>     qml.RX(x, wires=0)
  >>>     return qml.probs(wires=0)
  >>> circuit(0.54)
  array([0.94, 0.06])
  >>> circuit(0.54)
  array([0.93, 0.07])
  ```

* Catalyst gradient functions `grad`, `jacobian`, `jvp`, and `vjp` can now be invoked from
  outside a `@qjit` context.
  [(#375)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/375)

  This simplifies the process of writing functions where compilation
  can be turned on and off easily by adding or removing the decorator. The functions dispatch to
  their JAX equivalents when the compilation is turned off.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> grad(circuit)(0.54)  # dispatches to jax.grad
  Array(-0.51413599, dtype=float64, weak_type=True)
  >>> qjit(grad(circuit))(0.54). # differentiates using Catalyst
  array(-0.51413599)
  ```

* New `lightning.qubit` configuration options are now supported via the `qml.device` loader,
  including Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling support.
  [(#369)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/369)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2, shots=1000, mcmc=True)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.54)
  array(0.856)
  ```

* Improvements have been made to the runtime and quantum MLIR dialect in order
  to support asynchronous execution.

  - The runtime now supports multiple active devices managed via a device pool. The new `RTDevice`
    data-class and `RTDeviceStatus` along with the `thread_local` device instance pointer enable
    the runtime to better scope the lifetime of device instances concurrently. With these changes,
    one can create multiple active devices and execute multiple programs in a multithreaded
    environment.
    [(#381)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/381)

  - The ability to dynamically release devices has been added via `DeviceReleaseOp` in the Quantum
    MLIR dialect. This is lowered to the `__quantum__rt__device_release()` runtime instruction,
    which updates the status of the device instance from `Active` to `Inactive`. The runtime will reuse
    this deactivated instance instead of creating a new one automatically at runtime in a
    multi-QNode workflow when another device with identical specifications is requested.
    [(#381)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/381)

  - The `DeviceOp` definition in the Quantum MLIR dialect has been updated to lower a tuple
    of device information `('lib', 'name', 'kwargs')` to a single device initialization call
    `__quantum__rt__device_init(int8_t *, int8_t *, int8_t *)`. This allows the runtime to initialize
    device instances without keeping partial information of the device
    [(#396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/396)

* The quantum adjoint compiler routine has been extended to support function calls that affect the
  quantum state within an adjoint region. Note that the function may only provide a single result
  consisting of the quantum register. By itself this provides no user-facing changes, but compiler
  pass developers may now generate quantum adjoint operations around a block of code containing
  function calls as well as quantum operations and control flow operations.
  [(#353)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/353)

* The allocation and deallocation operations in MLIR (`AllocOp`, `DeallocOp`) now follow simple
  value semantics for qubit register values, instead of modelling memory in the MLIR trait system.
  Similarly, the frontend generates proper value semantics by deallocating the final register value.

  The change enables functions at the MLIR level to accept and return quantum register values,
  which would otherwise not be correctly identified as aliases of existing register values by the
  bufferization system.
  [(#360)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/360)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* Third party devices must now provide a configuration TOML file, in order to specify their
  supported operations, measurements, and features for Catalyst compatibility. For more information
  please visit the [Custom Devices](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/latest/dev/custom_devices.html) section in our documentation.
  [(#369)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/369)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Resolves a bug in the compiler's differentiation engine that results in a segmentation fault
  when [attempting to differentiate non-differentiable quantum operations](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/issues/384).
  The fix ensures that all existing quantum operation types are removed during gradient passes that
  extract classical code from a QNode function. It also adds a verification step that will raise an error
  if a gradient pass cannot successfully eliminate all quantum operations for such functions.
  [(#397)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/issues/397)

* Resolves a bug that caused unpredictable behaviour when printing string values with
  the `debug.print` function. The issue was caused by non-null-terminated strings.

# Release 0.3.2

<h3>New features</h3>

* The experimental AutoGraph feature now supports Python `while` loops, allowing native Python loops
  to be captured and compiled with Catalyst.
  [(#318)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/318)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=4)

  @qjit(autograph=True)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(n: int, x: float):
      i = 0

      while i < n:
          qml.RX(x, wires=i)
          i += 1

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(4, 0.32)
  array(0.94923542)
  ```

  This feature extends the existing AutoGraph support for Python `for` loops and `if` statements
  introduced in v0.3. Note that TensorFlow must be installed for AutoGraph support.

  For more details, please see the
  [AutoGraph guide](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/dev/autograph.html).

* In addition to loops and conditional branches, AutoGraph now supports native Python `and`, `or`
  and `not` operators in Boolean expressions.
  [(#325)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/325)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit(autograph=True)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x: float):

      if x >= 0 and x < jnp.pi:
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)

      return qml.probs()
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.43)
  array([0.95448287, 0.04551713])
  >>> circuit(4.54)
  array([1., 0.])
  ```

  Note that logical Boolean operators will only be captured by AutoGraph if all
  operands are dynamic variables (that is, a value known only at runtime, such
  as a measurement result or function argument). For other use
  cases, it is recommended to use the `jax.numpy.logical_*` set of functions where
  appropriate.

* Debug compiled programs and print dynamic values at runtime with ``debug.print``
  [(#279)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/279)
  [(#356)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/356)

  You can now print arbitrary values from your running program, whether they are arrays, constants,
  strings, or abitrary Python objects. Note that while non-array Python objects
  *will* be printed at runtime, their string representation is captured at
  compile time, and thus will always be the same regardless of program inputs.
  The output for arrays optionally includes a descriptor for how the data is stored in memory
  ("memref").

  ```python
  @qjit
  def func(x: float):
      debug.print(x, memref=True)
      debug.print("exit")
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> func(jnp.array(0.43))
  MemRef: base@ = 0x5629ff2b6680 rank = 0 offset = 0 sizes = [] strides = [] data =
  0.43
  exit
  ```

* Catalyst now officially supports macOS X86_64 devices, with macOS binary wheels
  available for both AARCH64 and X86_64.
  [(#347)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/347)
  [(#313)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/313)

* It is now possible to dynamically load third-party Catalyst compatible devices directly
  into a pre-installed Catalyst runtime on Linux.
  [(#327)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/327)

  To take advantage of this, third-party devices must implement the `Catalyst::Runtime::QuantumDevice`
  interface, in addition to defining the following method:

  ```cpp
  extern "C" Catalyst::Runtime::QuantumDevice*
  getCustomDevice() { return new CustomDevice(); }
  ```

  This support can also be integrated into existing PennyLane Python devices that inherit from
  the `QuantumDevice` class, by defining the `get_c_interface` static method.

  For more details, see the
  [custom devices documentation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/dev/custom_devices.html).

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Return values of conditional functions no longer need to be of exactly the same type.
  Type promotion is automatically applied to branch return values if their types don't match.
  [(#333)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/333)

  ```python
  @qjit
  def func(i: int, f: float):

      @cond(i < 3)
      def cond_fn():
          return i

      @cond_fn.otherwise
      def otherwise():
          return f

      return cond_fn()
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> func(1, 4.0)
  array(1.0)
  ```

  Automatic type promotion across conditional branches also works with AutoGraph:

  ```python
  @qjit(autograph=True)
  def func(i: int, f: float):

      if i < 3:
          i = i
      else:
          i = f

      return i
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> func(1, 4.0)
  array(1.0)
  ```

* AutoGraph now supports converting functions even when they are invoked through functional wrappers such
  as `adjoint`, `ctrl`, `grad`, `jacobian`, etc.
  [(#336)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/336)

  For example, the following should now succeed:

  ```python
  def inner(n):
    for i in range(n):
      qml.T(i)

  @qjit(autograph=True)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def f(n: int):
      adjoint(inner)(n)
      return qml.state()
  ```

* To prepare for Catalyst's frontend being integrated with PennyLane, the appropriate plugin entry point
  interface has been added to Catalyst.
  [(#331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/331)

  For any compiler packages seeking to be registered in PennyLane, the `entry_points`
  metadata under the the group name `pennylane.compilers` must be added, with the following entry points:

  - `context`: Path to the compilation evaluation context manager. This context manager should have
    the method `context.is_tracing()`, which returns True if called within a program that is being
    traced or captured.

  - `ops`: Path to the compiler operations module. This operations module may contain compiler
    specific versions of PennyLane operations. Within a JIT context, PennyLane operations may
    dispatch to these.

  - `qjit`: Path to the JIT compiler decorator provided by the compiler. This decorator should have
    the signature `qjit(fn, *args, **kwargs)`, where `fn` is the function to be compiled.

* The compiler driver diagnostic output has been improved, and now includes failing IR as well as
  the names of failing passes.
  [(#349)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/349)

* The scatter operation in the Catalyst dialect now uses an SCF for loop to avoid ballooning
  the compiled code.
  [(#307)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/307)

* The `CopyGlobalMemRefPass` pass of our MLIR processing pipeline now supports
  dynamically shaped arrays.
  [(#348)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/348)

* The Catalyst utility dialect is now included in the Catalyst MLIR C-API.
  [(#345)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/345)

* Fix an issue with the AutoGraph conversion system that would prevent the fallback to Python from
  working correctly in certain instances.
  [(#352)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/352)

  The following type of code is now supported:

  ```python
  @qjit(autograph=True)
  def f():
    l = jnp.array([1, 2])
    for _ in range(2):
        l = jnp.kron(l, l)
    return l
  ```

* Catalyst now supports `jax.numpy.polyfit` inside a qjitted function.
  [(#367)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/367/)

* Catalyst now supports custom calls (including the one from HLO). We added support in MLIR (operation, bufferization
  and lowering). In the `lib_custom_calls`, developers then implement their custom calls and use external functions
  directly (e.g. Lapack). The OpenBlas library is taken from Scipy and linked in Catalyst, therefore any function from
  it can be used.
  [(#367)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/367/)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The axis ordering for `catalyst.jacobian` is updated to match `jax.jacobian`. Assuming we have
  parameters of shape `[a,b]` and results of shape `[c,d]`, the returned Jacobian will now have
  shape `[c, d, a, b]` instead of `[a, b, c, d]`.
  [(#283)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/283)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* An upstream change in the PennyLane-Lightning project was addressed to prevent compilation issues
  in the `StateVectorLQubitDynamic` class in the runtime.
  The issue was introduced in [#499](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/499).
  [(#322)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/322)

* The `requirements.txt` file to build Catalyst from source has been updated with a minimum pip
  version, `>=22.3`. Previous versions of pip are unable to perform editable installs when the
  system-wide site-packages are read-only, even when the `--user` flag is provided.
  [(#311)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/311)

* The frontend has been updated to make it compatible with PennyLane `MeasurementProcess` objects
  now being PyTrees in PennyLane version 0.33.
  [(#315)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/315)

# Release 0.3.1

<h3>New features</h3>

* The experimental AutoGraph feature, now supports Python `for` loops, allowing native Python loops
  to be captured and compiled with Catalyst.
  [(#258)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/258)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=n)

  @qjit(autograph=True)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def f(n):
      for i in range(n):
          qml.Hadamard(wires=i)

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  This feature extends the existing AutoGraph support for Python `if` statements introduced in v0.3.
  Note that TensorFlow must be installed for AutoGraph support.

* The quantum control operation can now be used in conjunction with Catalyst control flow, such as
  loops and conditionals, via the new `catalyst.ctrl` function.
  [(#282)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/282)

  Similar in behaviour to the `qml.ctrl` control modifier from PennyLane, `catalyst.ctrl` can
  additionally wrap around quantum functions which contain control flow, such as the Catalyst
  `cond`, `for_loop`, and `while_loop` primitives.

  ```python
  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=4))
  def circuit(x):

      @for_loop(0, 3, 1)
      def repeat_rx(i):
          qml.RX(x / 2, wires=i)

      catalyst.ctrl(repeat_rx, control=3)()

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.2)
  array(1.)
  ```

* Catalyst now supports JAX's `array.at[index]` notation for array element assignment and updating.
  [(#273)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/273)

  ```python
  @qjit
  def add_multiply(l: jax.core.ShapedArray((3,), dtype=float), idx: int):
      res = l.at[idx].multiply(3)
      res2 = l.at[idx].add(2)
      return res + res2

  res = add_multiply(jnp.array([0, 1, 2]), 2)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> res
  [0, 2, 10]
  ```

  For more details on available methods, see the
  [JAX documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.ndarray.at.html).

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The Lightning backend device has been updated to work with the new PL-Lightning monorepo.
  [(#259)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/259)
  [(#277)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/277)

* A new compiler driver has been implemented in C++. This improves compile-time performance by
  avoiding *round-tripping*, which is when the entire program being compiled is dumped to
  a textual form and re-parsed by another tool.

  This is also a requirement for providing custom metadata at the LLVM level, which is
  necessary for better integration with tools like Enzyme. Finally, this makes it more natural
  to improve error messages originating from C++ when compared to the prior subprocess-based
  approach.
  [(#216)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/216)

* Support the `braket.devices.Devices` enum class and `s3_destination_folder`
  device options for AWS Braket remote devices.
  [(#278)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/278)

* Improvements have been made to the build process, including avoiding unnecessary processes such
  as removing `opt` and downloading the wheel.
  [(#298)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/298)

* Remove a linker warning about duplicate `rpath`s when Catalyst wheels are installed on macOS.
  [(#314)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/314)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fix incompatibilities with GCC on Linux introduced in v0.3.0 when compiling user programs.
  Due to these, Catalyst v0.3.0 only works when clang is installed in the user environment.

  - Resolve an issue with an empty linker flag, causing `ld` to error.
    [(#276)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/276)

  - Resolve an issue with undefined symbols provided the Catalyst runtime.
    [(#316)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/316)

* Remove undocumented package dependency on the zlib/zstd compression library.
  [(#308)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/308)

* Fix filesystem issue when compiling multiple functions with the same name and
  `keep_intermediate=True`.
  [(#306)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/306)

* Add support for applying the `adjoint` operation to `QubitUnitary` gates.
  `QubitUnitary` was not able to be `adjoint`ed when the variable holding the unitary matrix might
  change. This can happen, for instance, inside of a for loop.
  To solve this issue, the unitary matrix gets stored in the array list via push and pops.
  The unitary matrix is later reconstructed from the array list and `QubitUnitary` can be executed
  in the `adjoint`ed context.
  [(#304)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/304)

# Release 0.3.0

<h3>New features</h3>

* Catalyst now officially supports macOS ARM devices, such as Apple M1/M2 machines,
  with macOS binary wheels available on PyPI. For more details on the changes involved to support
  macOS, please see the improvements section.
  [(#229)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/230)
  [(#232)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/232)
  [(#233)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/233)
  [(#234)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/234)

* Write Catalyst-compatible programs with native Python conditional statements.
  [(#235)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/235)

  AutoGraph is a new, experimental, feature that automatically converts Python conditional
  statements like `if`, `else`, and `elif`, into their equivalent functional forms provided by
  Catalyst (such as `catalyst.cond`).

  This feature is currently opt-in, and requires setting the `autograph=True` flag in the `qjit`
  decorator:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit(autograph=True)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def f(x):
      if x < 0.5:
          qml.RY(jnp.sin(x), wires=0)
      else:
          qml.RX(jnp.cos(x), wires=0)

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  The implementation is based on the AutoGraph module from TensorFlow, and requires a working
  TensorFlow installation be available. In addition, Python loops (`for` and `while`) are not
  yet supported, and do not work in AutoGraph mode.

  Note that there are some caveats when using this feature especially around the use of global
  variables or object mutation inside of methods. A functional style is always recommended when
  using `qjit` or AutoGraph.

* The quantum adjoint operation can now be used in conjunction with Catalyst control flow, such as
  loops and conditionals. For this purpose a new instruction, `catalyst.adjoint`, has been added.
  [(#220)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/220)

  `catalyst.adjoint` can wrap around quantum functions which contain the Catalyst `cond`,
  `for_loop`, and `while_loop` primitives. Previously, the usage of `qml.adjoint` on functions with
  these primitives would result in decomposition errors. Note that a future release of Catalyst will
  merge the behaviour of `catalyst.adjoint` into `qml.adjoint` for convenience.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=3)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):

      @for_loop(0, 3, 1)
      def repeat_rx(i):
          qml.RX(x / 2, wires=i)

      adjoint(repeat_rx)()

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.2)
  array(0.99500417)
  ```

  Additionally, the ability to natively represent the adjoint construct in Catalyst's program
  representation (IR) was added.

* QJIT-compiled programs now support (nested) container types as inputs and outputs of compiled
  functions. This includes lists and dictionaries, as well as any data structure implementing the
  [PyTree protocol](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html).
  [(#215)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/215)
  [(#221)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/221)

  For example, a program that accepts and returns a mix of dictionaries, lists, and tuples:

  ```python
  @qjit
  def workflow(params1, params2):
      res1 = params1["a"][0][0] + params2[1]
      return {"y1": jnp.sin(res1), "y2": jnp.cos(res1)}
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> params1 = {"a": [[0.1], 0.2]}
  >>> params2 = (0.6, 0.8)
  >>> workflow(params1, params2)
  array(0.78332691)
  ```

* Compile-time backpropagation of arbitrary hybrid programs is now supported, via integration with
  [Enzyme AD](https://enzyme.mit.edu/).
  [(#158)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/158)
  [(#193)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/193)
  [(#224)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/224)
  [(#225)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/225)
  [(#239)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/239)
  [(#244)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/244)

  This allows `catalyst.grad` to differentiate hybrid functions that contain both classical
  pre-processing (inside & outside of QNodes), QNodes, as well as classical post-processing
  (outside of QNodes) via a combination of backpropagation and quantum gradient methods.

  The new default for the differentiation `method` attribute in `catalyst.grad` has been changed to
  `"auto"`, which performs Enzyme-based reverse mode AD on classical code, in conjunction with the
  quantum `diff_method` specified on each QNode:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="parameter-shift")
  def circuit(theta):
      qml.RX(jnp.exp(theta ** 2) / jnp.cos(theta / 4), wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> grad = qjit(catalyst.grad(circuit, method="auto"))
  >>> grad(jnp.pi)
  array(0.05938718)
  ```

  The reworked differentiation pipeline means you can now compute exact derivatives of programs with
  both classical pre- and post-processing, as shown below:

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1), diff_method="adjoint")
  def circuit(theta):
      qml.RX(jnp.exp(theta ** 2) / jnp.cos(theta / 4), wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=0))

  def loss(theta):
      return jnp.pi / jnp.tanh(circuit(theta))

  @qjit
  def grad_loss(theta):
      return catalyst.grad(loss)(theta)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> grad_loss(1.0)
  array(-1.90958669)
  ```

  You can also use multiple QNodes with different differentiation methods:

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1), diff_method="parameter-shift")
  def circuit_A(params):
      qml.RX(jnp.exp(params[0] ** 2) / jnp.cos(params[1] / 4), wires=0)
      return qml.probs()

  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1), diff_method="adjoint")
  def circuit_B(params):
      qml.RX(jnp.exp(params[1] ** 2) / jnp.cos(params[0] / 4), wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=0))

  def loss(params):
      return jnp.prod(circuit_A(params)) + circuit_B(params)

  @qjit
  def grad_loss(theta):
      return catalyst.grad(loss)(theta)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> grad_loss(jnp.array([1.0, 2.0]))
  array([ 0.57367285, 44.4911605 ])
  ```

  And you can differentiate purely classical functions as well:

  ```python
  def square(x: float):
      return x ** 2

  @qjit
  def dsquare(x: float):
      return catalyst.grad(square)(x)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> dsquare(2.3)
  array(4.6)
  ```

  Note that the current implementation of reverse mode AD is restricted to 1st order derivatives,
  but you can still use `catalyst.grad(method="fd")` is still available to perform a finite
  differences approximation of _any_ differentiable function.

* Add support for the new PennyLane arithmetic operators.
  [(#250)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/250)

  PennyLane is in the process of replacing `Hamiltonian` and `Tensor` observables with a set of
  general arithmetic operators. These consist of
  [Prod](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.ops.op_math.Prod.html),
  [Sum](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.ops.op_math.Sum.html) and
  [SProd](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.ops.op_math.SProd.html).

  By default, using dunder methods (eg. `+`, `-`, `@`, `*`) to combine
  operators with scalars or other operators will create `Hamiltonian` and
  `Tensor` objects. However, these two methods will be deprecated in coming
  releases of PennyLane.

  To enable the new arithmetic operators, one can use `Prod`, `Sum`, and
  `Sprod` directly or activate them by calling [enable_new_opmath](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.operation.enable_new_opmath.html)
  at the beginning of your PennyLane program.

  ``` python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x: float, y: float):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      qml.RX(y, wires=1)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.expval(0.2 * qml.PauliX(wires=0) - 0.4 * qml.PauliY(wires=1))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.operation.enable_new_opmath()
  >>> qml.operation.active_new_opmath()
  True
  >>> circuit(np.pi / 4, np.pi / 2)
  array(0.28284271)
  ```

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Better support for Hamiltonian observables:

  - Allow Hamiltonian observables with integer coefficients.
    [(#248)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/248)

    For example, compiling the following circuit wasn't previously allowed, but is
    now supported in Catalyst:

    ```python
    dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

    @qjit
    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(x: float, y: float):
        qml.RX(x, wires=0)
        qml.RY(y, wires=1)

        coeffs = [1, 2]
        obs = [qml.PauliZ(0), qml.PauliZ(1)]
        return qml.expval(qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs, obs))
    ```

  - Allow nested Hamiltonian observables.
    [(#255)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/255)

    ```python
    @qjit
    @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=3))
    def circuit(x, y, coeffs1, coeffs2):
        qml.RX(x, wires=0)
        qml.RX(y, wires=1)
        qml.RY(x + y, wires=2)

        obs = [
            qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1),
            qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs1, [qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.Hadamard(2)]),
        ]

        return qml.var(qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs2, obs))
    ```

* Various performance improvements:

  - The execution and compile time of programs has been reduced, by generating more efficient code
    and avoiding unnecessary optimizations. Specifically, a scalarization procedure was added to the
    MLIR pass pipeline, and LLVM IR compilation is now invoked with optimization level 0.
    [(#217)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/217)

  - The execution time of compiled functions has been improved in the frontend.
    [(#213)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/213)

    Specifically, the following changes have been made, which leads to a small but measurable
    improvement when using larger matrices as inputs, or functions with many inputs:

    + only loading the user program library once per compilation,
    + generating return value types only once per compilation,
    + avoiding unnecessary type promotion, and
    + avoiding unnecessary array copies.

  - Peak memory utilization of a JIT compiled program has been reduced, by allowing tensors to be
    scheduled for deallocation. Previously, the tensors were not deallocated until the end of the
    call to the JIT compiled function.
    [(#201)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/201)

* Various improvements have been made to enable Catalyst to compile on macOS:

  - Remove unnecessary `reinterpret_cast` from `ObsManager`. Removal of
    these `reinterpret_cast` allows compilation of the runtime to succeed
    in macOS. macOS uses an ILP32 mode for Aarch64 where they use the full 64
    bit mode but with 32 bit Integer, Long, and Pointers. This patch also
    changes a test file to prevent a mismatch in machines which compile using
    ILP32 mode.
    [(#229)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/230)

  - Allow runtime to be compiled on macOS. Substitute `nproc` with a call to
    `os.cpu_count()` and use correct flags for `ld.64`.
    [(#232)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/232)

  - Improve portability on the frontend to be available on macOS. Use
    `.dylib`, remove unnecessary flags, and address behaviour difference in
    flags.
    [(#233)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/233)

  - Small compatibility changes in order for all integration tests to succeed
    on macOS.
    [(#234)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/234)

* Dialects can compile with older versions of clang by avoiding type mismatches.
  [(#228)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/228)

* The runtime is now built against `qir-stdlib` pre-build artifacts.
  [(#236)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/236)

* Small improvements have been made to the CI/CD, including fixing the Enzyme
  cache, generalize caches to other operating systems, fix build wheel
  recipe, and remove references to QIR in runtime's Makefile.
  [(#243)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/243)
  [(#247)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/247)


<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* Support for Python 3.8 has been removed.
  [(#231)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/231)

* The default differentiation method on ``grad`` and ``jacobian`` is reverse-mode
  automatic differentiation instead of finite differences. When a QNode does not have a
  ``diff_method`` specified, it will default to using the parameter shift method instead of
  finite-differences.
  [(#244)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/244)
  [(#271)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/271)

* The JAX version used by Catalyst has been updated to `v0.4.14`, the minimum PennyLane version
  required is now `v0.32`.
  [(#264)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/264)

* Due to the change allowing Python container objects as inputs to QJIT-compiled functions, Python
  lists are no longer automatically converted to JAX arrays.
  [(#231)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/231)

  This means that indexing on lists when the index is not static will cause a
  `TracerIntegerConversionError`, consistent with JAX's behaviour.

  That is, the following example is no longer support:

  ```python
  @qjit
  def f(x: list, index: int):
      return x[index]
  ```

  However, if the parameter `x` above is a JAX or NumPy array, the compilation will continue to
  succeed.

* The `catalyst.grad` function has been renamed to `catalyst.jacobian` and supports differentiation
  of functions that return multiple or non-scalar outputs. A new `catalyst.grad` function has been
  added that enforces that it is differentiating a function with a single scalar return value.
  [(#254)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/254)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixed an issue preventing the differentiation of `qml.probs` with the parameter-shift method.
  [(#211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/211)

* Fixed the incorrect return value data-type with functions returning `qml.counts`.
  [(#221)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/221)

* Fix segmentation fault when differentiating a function where a quantum measurement is used
  multiple times by the same operation.
  [(#242)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/242)

# Release 0.2.1

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Add missing OpenQASM backend in binary distribution, which relies on the latest version of the
  AWS Braket plugin for PennyLane to resolve dependency issues between the plugin, Catalyst, and
  PennyLane. The Lightning-Kokkos backend with Serial and OpenMP modes is also added to the binary
  distribution.
  [#198](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/198)

* Return a list of decompositions when calling the decomposition method for control operations.
  This allows Catalyst to be compatible with upstream PennyLane.
  [#241](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/241)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* When using OpenQASM-based devices the string representation of the circuit is printed on
  exception.
  [#199](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/199)

* Use ``pybind11::module`` interface library instead of ``pybind11::embed`` in the runtime for
  OpenQasm backend to avoid linking to the python library at compile time.

# Release 0.2.0

<h3>New features</h3>

* Catalyst programs can now be used inside of a larger JAX workflow which uses
  JIT compilation, automatic differentiation, and other JAX transforms.
  [#96](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/96)
  [#123](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/123)
  [#167](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/167)
  [#192](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/192)

  For example, call a Catalyst qjit-compiled function from within a JAX jit-compiled
  function:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(jnp.pi * x[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(x[1] ** 2, wires=0)
      qml.RX(x[1] * x[2], wires=0)
      return qml.probs(wires=0)

  @jax.jit
  def cost_fn(weights):
      x = jnp.sin(weights)
      return jnp.sum(jnp.cos(circuit(x)) ** 2)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> cost_fn(jnp.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))
  Array(1.32269195, dtype=float64)
  ```

  Catalyst-compiled functions can now also be automatically differentiated
  via JAX, both in forward and reverse mode to first-order,

  ```pycon
  >>> jax.grad(cost_fn)(jnp.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))
  Array([0.49249037, 0.05197949, 0.02991883], dtype=float64)
  ```

  as well as vectorized using `jax.vmap`:

  ```pycon
  >>> jax.vmap(cost_fn)(jnp.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]))
  Array([1.32269195, 1.53905377], dtype=float64)
  ```

  In particular, this allows for a reduction in boilerplate when using
  JAX-compatible optimizers such as `jaxopt`:

  ```pycon
  >>> opt = jaxopt.GradientDescent(cost_fn)
  >>> params = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
  >>> (final_params, _) = jax.jit(opt.run)(params)
  >>> final_params
  Array([-0.00320799,  0.03475223,  0.29362844], dtype=float64)
  ```

  Note that, in general, best performance will be seen when the Catalyst
  `@qjit` decorator is used to JIT the entire hybrid workflow. However, there
  may be cases where you may want to delegate only the quantum part of your
  workflow to Catalyst, and let JAX handle classical components (for example,
  due to missing a feature or compatibility issue in Catalyst).

* Support for Amazon Braket devices provided via the PennyLane-Braket plugin.
  [#118](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/118)
  [#139](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/139)
  [#179](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/179)
  [#180](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/180)

  This enables quantum subprograms within a JIT-compiled Catalyst workflow to
  execute on Braket simulator and hardware devices, including remote
  cloud-based simulators such as SV1.

  ```python
  def circuit(x, y):
      qml.RX(y * x, wires=0)
      qml.RX(x * 2, wires=1)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliY(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))

  @qjit
  def workflow(x: float, y: float):
      device = qml.device("braket.local.qubit", backend="braket_sv", wires=2)
      g = qml.qnode(device)(circuit)
      h = catalyst.grad(g)
      return h(x, y)

  workflow(1.0, 2.0)
  ```

  For a list of available devices, please see the [PennyLane-Braket](https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  documentation.

  Internally, the quantum instructions are generating OpenQASM3 kernels at
  runtime; these are then executed on both local (`braket.local.qubit`) and
  remote (`braket.aws.qubit`) devices backed by Amazon Braket Python SDK,

  with measurement results then propagated back to the frontend.

  Note that at initial release, not all Catalyst features are supported with Braket.
  In particular, dynamic circuit features, such as mid-circuit measurements, will
  not work with Braket devices.

* Catalyst conditional functions defined via `@catalyst.cond` now support an arbitrary
  number of 'else if' chains.
  [#104](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/104)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):

      @catalyst.cond(x > 2.7)
      def cond_fn():
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)

      @cond_fn.else_if(x > 1.4)
      def cond_elif():
          qml.RY(x, wires=0)

      @cond_fn.otherwise
      def cond_else():
          qml.RX(x ** 2, wires=0)

      cond_fn()

      return qml.probs(wires=0)
  ```

* Iterating in reverse is now supported with constant negative step sizes via `catalyst.for_loop`.
  [#129](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/129)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(n):

      @catalyst.for_loop(n, 0, -1)
      def loop_fn(_):
          qml.PauliX(0)

      loop_fn()
      return measure(0)
  ```

* Additional gradient transforms for computing the vector-Jacobian product (VJP)
  and Jacobian-vector product (JVP) are now available in Catalyst.
  [#98](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/98)

  Use `catalyst.vjp` to compute the forward-pass value and VJP:

  ```python
  @qjit
  def vjp(params, cotangent):
      def f(x):
          y = [jnp.sin(x[0]), x[1] ** 2, x[0] * x[1]]
          return jnp.stack(y)

      return catalyst.vjp(f, [params], [cotangent])
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> x = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2])
  >>> dy = jnp.array([-0.5, 0.1, 0.3])
  >>> vjp(x, dy)
  [array([0.09983342, 0.04      , 0.02      ]),
   array([-0.43750208,  0.07000001])]
  ```

  Use `catalyst.jvp` to compute the forward-pass value and JVP:

  ```python
  @qjit
  def jvp(params, tangent):
      def f(x):
          y = [jnp.sin(x[0]), x[1] ** 2, x[0] * x[1]]
          return jnp.stack(y)

      return catalyst.jvp(f, [params], [tangent])
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> x = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2])
  >>> tangent = jnp.array([0.3, 0.6])
  >>> jvp(x, tangent)
  [array([0.09983342, 0.04      , 0.02      ]),
   array([0.29850125, 0.24000006, 0.12      ])]
  ```

* Support for multiple backend devices within a single qjit-compiled function
  is now available.
  [#86](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/86)
  [#89](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/89)

  For example, if you compile the Catalyst runtime
  with `lightning.kokkos` support (via the compilation flag
  `ENABLE_LIGHTNING_KOKKOS=ON`), you can use `lightning.qubit` and
  `lightning.kokkos` within a singular workflow:

  ```python
  dev1 = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)
  dev2 = qml.device("lightning.kokkos", wires=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev1)
  def circuit1(x):
      qml.RX(jnp.pi * x[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(x[1] ** 2, wires=0)
      qml.RX(x[1] * x[2], wires=0)
      return qml.var(qml.PauliZ(0))

  @qml.qnode(dev2)
  def circuit2(x):

      @catalyst.cond(x > 2.7)
      def cond_fn():
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)

      @cond_fn.otherwise
      def cond_else():
          qml.RX(x ** 2, wires=0)

      cond_fn()

      return qml.probs(wires=0)

  @qjit
  def cost(x):
      return circuit2(circuit1(x))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> x = jnp.array([0.54, 0.31])
  >>> cost(x)
  array([0.80842369, 0.19157631])
  ```

* Support for returning the variance of Hamiltonians,
  Hermitian matrices, and Tensors via `qml.var` has been added.
  [#124](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/124)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(jnp.pi * x[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(x[1] ** 2, wires=1)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      qml.RX(x[1] * x[2], wires=0)
      return qml.var(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliX(1))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> x = jnp.array([0.54, 0.31])
  >>> circuit(x)
  array(0.98851544)
  ```

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The `catalyst.grad` function now supports using the differentiation
  method defined on the QNode (via the `diff_method` argument) rather than
  applying a global differentiation method.
  [#163](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/163)

  As part of this change, the `method` argument now accepts
  the following options:

  - `method="auto"`:  Quantum components of the hybrid function are
    differentiated according to the corresponding QNode `diff_method`, while
    the classical computation is differentiated using traditional auto-diff.

    With this strategy, Catalyst only currently supports QNodes with
    `diff_method="param-shift" and `diff_method="adjoint"`.

  - `method="fd"`: First-order finite-differences for the entire hybrid function.
    The `diff_method` argument for each QNode is ignored.

  This is an intermediate step towards differentiating functions that
  internally call multiple QNodes, and towards supporting differentiation of
  classical postprocessing.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Catalyst has been upgraded to work with JAX v0.4.13.
  [#143](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/143)
  [#185](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/185)

* Add a Backprop operation for using autodifferentiation (AD) at the LLVM
  level with Enzyme AD. The Backprop operations has a bufferization pattern
  and a lowering to LLVM.
  [#107](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/107)
  [#116](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/116)

* Error handling has been improved. The runtime now throws more descriptive
  and unified expressions for runtime errors and assertions.
  [#92](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/92)

* In preparation for easier debugging, the compiler has been refactored to
  allow easy prototyping of new compilation pipelines.
  [#38](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/38)

  In the future, this will allow the ability to generate MLIR or LLVM-IR by
  loading input from a string or file, rather than generating it from Python.

  As part of this refactor, the following changes were made:

  - Passes are now classes. This allows developers/users looking to change
    flags to inherit from these passes and change the flags.

  - Passes are now passed as arguments to the compiler. Custom passes can just
    be passed to the compiler as an argument, as long as they implement a run
    method which takes an input and the output of this method can be fed to
    the next pass.

* Improved Python compatibility by providing a stable signature for user
  generated functions.
  [#106](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/106)

* Handle C++ exceptions without unwinding the whole stack.
  [#99](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/99)

* Reduce the number of classical invocations by counting the number of gate parameters in
  the `argmap` function.
  [#136](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/136)

  Prior to this, the computation of hybrid gradients executed all of the classical code
  being differentiated in a `pcount` function that solely counted the number of gate
  parameters in the quantum circuit. This was so `argmap` and other downstream
  functions could allocate memrefs large enough to store all gate parameters.

  Now, instead of counting the number of parameters separately, a dynamically-resizable
  array is used in the `argmap` function directly to store the gate parameters. This
  removes one invocation of all of the classical code being differentiated.

* Use Tablegen to define MLIR passes instead of C++ to reduce overhead of adding new passes.
  [#157](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/157)

* Perform constant folding on wire indices for `quantum.insert` and `quantum.extract` ops,
  used when writing (resp. reading) qubits to (resp. from) quantum registers.
  [#161](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/161)

* Represent known named observables as members of an MLIR Enum rather than a raw integer.
  This improves IR readability.
  [#165](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/165)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fix a bug in the mapping from logical to concrete qubits for mid-circuit measurements.
  [#80](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/80)

* Fix a bug in the way gradient result type is inferred.
  [#84](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/84)

* Fix a memory regression and reduce memory footprint by removing unnecessary
  temporary buffers.
  [#100](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/100)

* Provide a new abstraction to the `QuantumDevice` interface in the runtime
  called `DataView`. C++ implementations of the interface can iterate
  through and directly store results into the `DataView` independent of the
  underlying memory layout. This can eliminate redundant buffer copies at the
  interface boundaries, which has been applied to existing devices.
  [#109](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/109)

* Reduce memory utilization by transferring ownership of buffers from the
  runtime to Python instead of copying them. This includes adding a compiler
  pass that copies global buffers into the heap as global buffers cannot be
  transferred to Python.
  [#112](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/112)

* Temporary fix of use-after-free and dependency of uninitialized memory.
  [#121](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/121)

* Fix file renaming within pass pipelines.
  [#126](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/126)

* Fix the issue with the `do_queue` deprecation warnings in PennyLane.
  [#146](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/146)

* Fix the issue with gradients failing to work with hybrid functions that
  contain constant `jnp.array` objects. This will enable PennyLane operators
  that have data in the form of a `jnp.array`, such as a Hamiltonian, to be
  included in a qjit-compiled function.
  [#152](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/152)

  An example of a newly supported workflow:

  ```python
  coeffs = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2])
  terms = [qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1), qml.PauliZ(0)]
  H = qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs, terms)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
  def circuit(x):
    qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
    qml.RY(x[1], wires=0)
    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
    return qml.expval(H)

  params = jnp.array([0.3, 0.4])
  jax.grad(circuit)(params)
  ```

# Release 0.1.2

<h3>New features</h3>

* Add an option to print verbose messages explaining the compilation process.
  [#68](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/68)

* Allow ``catalyst.grad`` to be used on any traceable function (within a qjit context).
  This means the operation is no longer restricted to acting on ``qml.qnode``s only.
  [#75](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/75)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Work in progress on a Lightning-Kokkos backend:

  Bring feature parity to the Lightning-Kokkos backend simulator.
  [#55](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/55)

  Add support for variance measurements for all observables.
  [#70](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/70)

* Build the runtime against qir-stdlib v0.1.0.
  [#58](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/58)

* Replace input-checking assertions with exceptions.
  [#67](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/67)

* Perform function inlining to improve optimizations and memory management within the compiler.
  [#72](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/72)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Several fixes to address memory leaks in the compiled program:

  Fix memory leaks from data that flows back into the Python environment.
  [#54](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/54)

  Fix memory leaks resulting from partial bufferization at the MLIR level. This fix makes the
  necessary changes to reintroduce the ``-buffer-deallocation`` pass into the MLIR pass pipeline.
  The pass guarantees that all allocations contained within a function (that is allocations that are
  not returned from a function) are also deallocated.
  [#61](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/61)

  Lift heap allocations for quantum op results from the runtime into the MLIR compiler core. This
  allows all memref buffers to be memory managed in MLIR using the
  [MLIR bufferization infrastructure](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Bufferization/).
  [#63](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/63)

  Eliminate all memory leaks by tracking memory allocations at runtime. The memory allocations
  which are still alive when the compiled function terminates, will be freed in the
  finalization / teardown function.
  [#78](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/78)

* Fix returning complex scalars from the compiled function.
  [#77](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/77)
