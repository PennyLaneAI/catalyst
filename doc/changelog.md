# Release 0.2.0-dev

<h3>New features</h3>

* Catalyst programs can now be used inside of a larger JAX workflow which uses JIT compilation,
  automatic differentiation, and other JAX transforms.
  [#96](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/96)
  [#123](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/123)
  [#167](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/167)

  Note that generally Catalyst should be used to JIT the entire workflow, but sometimes users may
  wish to delegate only the quantum part of their workflow to Catalyst and let JAX handle the rest
  (for example due to missing a feature or compatibility issue in Catalyst).

  Examples of newly supported workflows:

   * JIT compilation with JAX:

     ```py
     @qjit
     @qml.qnode(dev)
     def circuit(x):
         qml.RX(jnp.pi * x[0], wires=0)
         qml.RY(x[1] ** 2, wires=0)
         qml.RX(x[1] * x[2], wires=0)
         return qml.probs(wires=0)

     @jax.jit
     def cost_fn(weights):
         x = jnp.sin(weights)
         return jnp.sum(jnp.cos(circuit(x)) ** 2)

     cost_fn(jnp.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))
     ```

   * Automatic differentiation with JAX, both in forward and reverse mode, but to first-order only:

     ```py
     @qjit
     @qml.qnode(dev)
     def circuit(x):
         qml.RX(jnp.pi * x[0], wires=0)
         qml.RY(x[1] ** 2, wires=0)
         qml.RX(x[1] * x[2], wires=0)
         return qml.probs(wires=0)

     def cost_fn(weights):
         x = jnp.sin(weights)
         return jnp.sum(jnp.cos(circuit(x)) ** 2)

     jax.grad(cost_fn)(jnp.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))
     ```

   * Vectorization of quantum functions with JAX:

     ```py
     @qjit
     @qml.qnode(dev)
     def circuit(x):
         qml.RX(jnp.pi * x[0], wires=0)
         qml.RY(x[1] ** 2, wires=0)
         qml.RX(x[1] * x[2], wires=0)
         return qml.probs(wires=0)

     def cost_fn(weights):
         x = jnp.sin(weights)
         return jnp.sum(jnp.cos(circuit(x)) ** 2)

     jax.vmap(cost_fn)(jnp.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]))
     ```

* Add a Backprop operation for using AD at the LLVM level with Enzyme AD. It has a
  bufferization pattern and a lowering to LLVM.
  [#107](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/107)
  [#116](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/116)

* Add support for ``else if`` chains for ``@cond`` conditionals
  [#104](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/104)

* Add the end-to-end support for multiple backend devices. The compilation flag
  ``ENABLE_LIGHTNING_KOKKOS=ON`` builds the runtime with support for PennyLane's
  ``lightning.kokkos``. Both ``lightning.qubit`` and ``lightning.kokkos`` can be
  chosen as available backend devices from the frontend.
  [#89](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/89)

* Add support for ``var`` of general observables
  [#124](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/124)

* Add support for Jacobian product operations. The function ``jvp(f, params, tangents)`` returns
  the Jacobian-vector product of a function ``f``, and the ``vjp(f, params, cotangents)`` returns
  its vector-Jacobian product.

  [#98](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/98)

  An example of a newly supported workflow:


  ``` python
  from catalyst import jvp

  def f(p):
    return jnp.stack([1*p, 2*p, 3*p])

  @qjit
  def workflow(params, tangent):
    return jvp(f, [params], [tangent])

  workflow(jnp.zeros([4], dtype=float), jnp.ones([4], dtype=float))
  ```

* Add support for generating OpenQasm3 kernels from the ``QuantumDevice`` API in the runtime.
  [#118](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/118)

* Add end-to-end support for execution of OpenQasm3 kernels on Amazon Braket devices.
  [#139](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/139)

  This feature enables JIT compilation of the quantum part of a PennyLane program into a standalone OpenQasm3 kernel.
  It executes the generated OpenQasm3 kernels on both local (``braket.local.qubit``) and remote (``braket.aws.qubit``)
  devices backed by Amazon Braket Python SDK at runtime, and propagates the measurement results back to the frontend.
  However, there are still some limitations with this support. For instance, it currently only works for static circuits
  and does not support mid-circuit measurements.

  In the following example, the OpenQasm3 kernel associated with ``circuit`` is generated at runtime and executed on
  the Braket state-vector simulator locally:

  ``` python
  def circuit(x, y):
      qml.RX(y * x, wires=0)
      qml.RX(x * 2, wires=1)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliY(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))

  @qjit
  def workflow(x: float, y: float):
      device = qml.device("braket.local.qubit", backend="braket_sv", wires=2)
      g = qml.qnode(device)(circuit)
      h = catalyst.grad(g)
      return h(x, y)

  workflow(1.0, 2.0)
  ```

* Add ``qml.Hermitian`` support to the OpenQasm3/Braket backend device.
  [#179](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/179)

  ``` python
  @qjit()
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("braket.local.qubit", backend="braket_sv", wires=1))
  def circuit(x: float):
      qml.RY(x, wires=0)
      A = np.array(
          [[complex(1.0, 0.0), complex(2.0, 0.0)], [complex(2.0, 0.0), complex(1.0, 0.0)]]
      )
      return qml.expval(qml.Hermitian(A, wires=0))

  circuit(1.0)
  ```

* Add ``qml.QubitUnitary`` support to the OpenQasm3/Braket backend device.
  [#180](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/180)

  ``` python
  @qjit()
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("braket.local.qubit", backend="braket_sv", wires=1))
  def circuit(x: float):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      U = 1 / np.sqrt(2) * np.array([[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, -1.0]], dtype=complex)
      qml.QubitUnitary(U, wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

  circuit(1.0)
  ```

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Improving error handling by throwing descriptive and unified expressions for runtime
  errors and assertions.
  [#92](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/92)

* Improve interface for adding and re-using flags to quantum-opt commands.
  These are called pipelines, as they contain multiple passes.
  [#38](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/38)

* Improve python compatibility by providing a stable signature for user generated functions.
  [#106](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/106)

* Handle C++ exceptions without unwinding the whole stack.
  [#99](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/99)

* Support constant negative step sizes in ``@for_loop`` loops.
  [#129](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/129)

* Reduce the number of classical invocations by counting the number of gate parameters in
  the ``argmap`` function.
  [#136](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/136)

  Prior to this, the computation of hybrid gradients executed all of the classical code
  being differentiated in a ``pcount`` function that solely counted the number of gate
  parameters in the quantum circuit. This was so ``argmap`` and other downstream
  functions could allocate memrefs large enough to store all gate parameters.

  Now, instead of counting the number of parameters separately, a dynamically-resizable
  array is used in the ``argmap`` function directly to store the gate parameters. This
  removes one invocation of all of the classical code being differentiated.

* Use Tablegen to define MLIR passes instead of C++ to reduce overhead of adding new passes.
  [#157](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/157)

* Update JAX to `v0.4.10`.
  [#143](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/143)

* Perform constant folding on wire indices for ``quantum.insert`` and ``quantum.extract`` ops,
  used when writing (resp. reading) qubits to (resp. from) quantum registers.
  [#161](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/161)

* Use the differentiation method on the QNode rather than the ``grad`` function to better
  match PennyLane's differentiation API.

  This is an intermediate step towards differentiating functions that internally call multiple
  QNodes, and towards supporting differentiation of classical postprocessing.
  [#163](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/163)

* Represent known named observables as members of an MLIR Enum rather than a raw integer.
  This improves IR readability.
  [#165](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/165)

* Update JAX to ``v0.4.13``.
  [#185](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/185)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fix a bug in the mapping from logical to concrete qubits for mid-circuit measurements.
  [#80](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/80)

* Fix a bug in the way gradient result type is inferred.
  [#84](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/84)

* Fix a memory regression and reduce memory footprint by removing unnecessary temporary buffers.
  [#100](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/100)

* Provide a new abstraction to the ``QuantumDevice`` interface in the runtime called ``MemRefView``.
  C++ implementations of the interface can iterate through and directly store results into the
  ``MemRefView`` independant of the underlying memory layout. This can eliminate redundant buffer
  copies at the interface boundaries, which has been applied to existing devices.
  [#109](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/109)

* Reduce memory utilization by transferring ownership of buffers from the runtime to Python instead
  of copying them. This includes adding a compiler pass that copies global buffers into the heap
  as global buffers cannot be transferred to Python.
  [#112](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/112)

* Temporary fix of use-after-free and dependency of uninitialized memory.
  [#121](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/121)

* Fixes file renaming within pass pipelines.
  [#126](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/126)

* Fixes the issue with the ``do_queue`` deprecation warnings in PennyLane.
  [#146](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/146)

* Fixes the issue with gradients failing to work with ``jnp.array`` as constants.
  [#152](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/152)

  An example of a newly supported workflow:

  ``` python
  coeffs = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2])
  terms = [qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1), qml.PauliZ(0)]
  H = qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs, terms)

  @qjit
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
  def circuit(x):
    qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
    qml.RY(x[1], wires=0)
    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
    return qml.expval(H)

  params = jnp.array([0.3, 0.4])
  jax.grad(circuit)(params)
  ```

# Release 0.1.2

<h3>New features</h3>

* Add an option to print verbose messages explaining the compilation process.
  [#68](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/68)

* Allow ``catalyst.grad`` to be used on any traceable function (within a qjit context).
  This means the operation is no longer resticted to acting on ``qml.qnode``s only.
  [#75](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/75)


<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Work in progress on a Lightning-Kokkos backend:

  Bring feature parity to the Lightning-Kokkos backend simulator.
  [#55](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/55)

  Add support for variance measurements for all observables.
  [#70](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/70)

* Build the runtime against qir-stdlib v0.1.0.
  [#58](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/58)

* Replace input-checking assertions with exceptions.
  [#67](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/67)

* Perform function inlining to improve optimizations and memory management within the compiler.
  [#72](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/72)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Several fixes to address memory leaks in the compiled program:

  Fix memory leaks from data that flows back into the Python environment.
  [#54](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/54)

  Fix memory leaks resulting from partial bufferization at the MLIR level. This fix makes the
  necessary changes to reintroduce the ``-buffer-deallocation`` pass into the MLIR pass pipeline.
  The pass guarantees that all allocations contained within a function (that is allocations that are
  not returned from a function) are also deallocated.
  [#61](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/61)

  Lift heap allocations for quantum op results from the runtime into the MLIR compiler core. This
  allows all memref buffers to be memory managed in MLIR using the
  [MLIR bufferization infrastructure](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Bufferization/).
  [#63](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/63)

  Eliminate all memory leaks by tracking memory allocations at runtime. The memory allocations
  which are still alive when the compiled function terminates, will be freed in the
  finalization / teardown function.
  [#78](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/78)

* Fix returning complex scalars from the compiled function.
  [#77](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/77)
