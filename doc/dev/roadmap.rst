Roadmap
=======

- **Frontend:** As we continue to build out Catalyst, the PennyLane frontend
  will likely be upstreamed into PennyLane proper, providing native JIT
  functionality built-in to PennyLane. The Catalyst compiler and runtime will
  remain part of the Catalyst project. *If you are interested in working on
  additional frontends for Catalyst, please get in touch.*

- **Compiler:** We will continue to build out the compiler stack, and add
  quantum compilation routines. This includes an API for providing or writing
  Catalyst-compatible compilation routines. In addition, we will be improving
  the autodifferentiation support, and adding support for classical autodiff,
  additional quantum gradients, and quantum-aware optimization methods.

- **Runtime:** We will be adding support for more devices, including quantum
  hardware devices. In addition, we will be building out support for
  hetereogeneous execution. *If you are interested in working on connecting a
  backend device with Catalyst, please get in touch.*

To figure out the details, we need your help --- please send us your use cases by starting a
conversation, or trying Catalyst out.
