# Release 0.1.2

<h3>New features</h3>

* Add an option to print verbose messages explaining the compilation process.
  [#68](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/68)

* Allow ``catalyst.grad`` to be used on any traceable function (within a qjit context).
  This means the operation is no longer restricted to acting on ``qml.qnode``s only.
  [#75](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/75)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Work in progress on a Lightning-Kokkos backend:

  Bring feature parity to the Lightning-Kokkos backend simulator.
  [#55](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/55)

  Add support for variance measurements for all observables.
  [#70](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/70)

* Build the runtime against qir-stdlib v0.1.0.
  [#58](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/58)

* Replace input-checking assertions with exceptions.
  [#67](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/67)

* Perform function inlining to improve optimizations and memory management within the compiler.
  [#72](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/72)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Several fixes to address memory leaks in the compiled program:

  Fix memory leaks from data that flows back into the Python environment.
  [#54](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/54)

  Fix memory leaks resulting from partial bufferization at the MLIR level. This fix makes the
  necessary changes to reintroduce the ``-buffer-deallocation`` pass into the MLIR pass pipeline.
  The pass guarantees that all allocations contained within a function (that is allocations that are
  not returned from a function) are also deallocated.
  [#61](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/61)

  Lift heap allocations for quantum op results from the runtime into the MLIR compiler core. This
  allows all memref buffers to be memory managed in MLIR using the
  [MLIR bufferization infrastructure](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Bufferization/).
  [#63](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/63)

  Eliminate all memory leaks by tracking memory allocations at runtime. The memory allocations
  which are still alive when the compiled function terminates, will be freed in the
  finalization / teardown function.
  [#78](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/78)

* Fix returning complex scalars from the compiled function.
  [#77](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/77)
