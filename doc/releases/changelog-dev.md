# Release 0.11.0 (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Add loop boundary optimization pass that identifies and optimizes redundant quantum operations that occur at loop iteration boundaries, where operations at iteration boundaries often cancel each other out. 
  [(#1476)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1476)

  This optimization help to eliminates redundant operations that aims to reduce quantum circuit depth and gate count.This pass is supported into `cancel_inverses` and `merge_rotations`.

  For example,

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qjit
  @catalyst.passes.cancel_inverses
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      for i in range(3):
          qml.Hadamard(0)
          qml.CNOT([0, 1])
          qml.Hadamard(0)
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  Note that this optimization specifically targets operations that are exact inverses of each other when applied in sequence. For example, consecutive Hadamard gates (H‚Ä†H = I) pairs will be identified and eliminated.

* Conversion Clifford+T gates to Pauli Product Rotation (PPR) and measurement to Pauli Product Measurement (PPM) are now available through the `to_ppr` pass transform.

  [(#1499)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1499)
  [(#1551)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1551)
  [(#1564)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1564)

  Supported gate conversions:
    - H gate ‚Üí PPR with (Z ¬∑ X ¬∑ Z)œÄ/4
    - S gate ‚Üí PPR with (Z)œÄ/4
    - T gate ‚Üí PPR with (Z)œÄ/8
    - CNOT ‚Üí PPR with (Z ‚äó X)œÄ/4 ¬∑ (Z ‚äó 1)‚àíœÄ/4 ¬∑ (1 ‚äó X)‚àíœÄ/4

    Example:
    ```python
        @qjit(keep_intermediate=True)
        @to_ppr
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit():
            qml.H(0)
            qml.S(1)
            qml.T(0)
            qml.CNOT([0, 1])
            m1 = catalyst.measure(wires=0)
            m2 = catalyst.measure(wires=1)
            return m1, m2
        circuit()
    ```

    The PPRs and PPMs are currently only represented symbolically. However, these operations are not yet executable on any backend since they exist purely as intermediate representations for analysis and potential future execution when a suitable backend is available.

    Example MLIR Representation:
    ```mlir
      . . .
        %0 = quantum.alloc( 2) : !quantum.reg
        %1 = quantum.extract %0[ 1] : !quantum.reg -> !quantum.bit
        %2 = qec.ppr ["Z"](4) %1 : !quantum.bit
        %3 = quantum.extract %0[ 0] : !quantum.reg -> !quantum.bit
        %4 = qec.ppr ["Z"](4) %3 : !quantum.bit
        %5 = qec.ppr ["X"](4) %4 : !quantum.bit
        %6 = qec.ppr ["Z"](4) %5 : !quantum.bit
        %7 = qec.ppr ["Z"](8) %6 : !quantum.bit
        %8:2 = qec.ppr ["Z", "X"](4) %7, %2 : !quantum.bit, !quantum.bit
        %9 = qec.ppr ["Z"](-4) %8#0 : !quantum.bit
        %10 = qec.ppr ["X"](-4) %8#1 : !quantum.bit
        %mres, %out_qubits = qec.ppm ["Z"] %9 : !quantum.bit
        %mres_0, %out_qubits_1 = qec.ppm ["Z"] %10 : !quantum.bit
      . . .
    ```

* Commuting Clifford Pauli Product Rotation (PPR) operations to the end of a circuit, past non-Clifford PPRs, is now available through the :func:`~.catalyst.passes.commute_ppr` pass transform.
  [(#1563)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1563)
  
  A PPR is a rotation gate of the form :math:`\exp{iP \theta}`, where :math:`P` is a Pauli word (a product of Pauli operators). Clifford PPRs refer to PPRs with :math:`\theta = \tfrac{\pi}{4}`, while non-Clifford PPRs have :math:`\theta = \tfrac{\pi}{8}`.

  
  Example:
  ```python
    @qjit(keep_intermediate=True)
    @pipeline({"to_ppr": {}, "commute_ppr": {}})
    @qml.qnode(qml.device("null.qubit", wires=1))
    def circuit():
        qml.H(0)
        qml.T(0)
        return measure(0)
    ```
  
  The circuit program that generated from this pass is currrently not executable on any backend. For more information regarding to PPM, please refer to [(Pauli Product Measurement)](https://pennylane.ai/compilation/pauli-product-measurement)

* Absorbing Clifford Pauli Product Rotation (PPR) operations into the final Pauli Product Measurement (PPM) is not availble through the :func:`~.catalyst.passes.ppr_to_ppm` pass transform. The output from this pass consists of non-Clifford PPRs and PPMs.
  [(#1577)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1577)

  Example:
  ```python
    @qjit(keep_intermediate=True)
    @pipeline({"to_ppr": {}, "commute_ppr": {}, "ppr_to_ppm": {}})
    @qml.qnode(qml.device("null.qubit", wires=1))
    def circuit():
        qml.H(0)
        qml.T(0)
        return measure(0)
  ```

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

* Changed pattern rewritting in `quantum-to-ion` lowering pass to use MLIR's dialect conversion
  infrastracture.
  [(#1442)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1442)

* Extend `merge-rotations` peephole optimization pass to also merge compatible rotation gates (either both controlled, or both uncontrolled) where rotation angles are any combination of static constants or dynamic values.
  [(#1489)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1489)

* Catalyst now supports experimental capture of `cond`, `for_loop` and `while_loop` control flow.
  [(#1468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1468)
  [(#1509)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1509)
  [(#1521)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1521)

  To trigger the PennyLane pipeline for capturing the program as a Jaxpr, simply set
  `experimental_capture=True` in the qjit decorator.

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  from catalyst import qjit

  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit(experimental_capture=True)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x: float):

      def ansatz_true():
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)
          qml.Hadamard(wires=0)

      def ansatz_false():
          qml.RY(x, wires=0)

      qml.cond(x > 1.4, ansatz_true, ansatz_false)()

      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

* Catalyst now supports experimental capture of PennyLane transforms.
  [(#1544)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1544)
  [(#1561)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1561)
  [(#1567)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1567)
  [(#1578)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1578)

  To trigger the PennyLane pipeline for capturing the mentioned transforms,
  simply set `experimental_capture=True` in the qjit decorator. If available,
  Catalyst will apply its own pass in replacement of the original transform
  provided by PennyLane. Otherwise, the transform will be expanded according
  to PennyLane rules.

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  from catalyst import qjit

  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qjit(experimental_capture=True)
  def func(x: float):
      @qml.transforms.cancel_inverses
      @qml.qnode(dev)
      def circuit(x: float):
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)
          qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
          qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
          return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

      return circuit(x)
  ```

* Changes to reduce compile time:

  - Turn off MLIR's verifier.
    [(#1513)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1513)
  - Remove unnecessary I/O.
    [(#1514)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1514)
  - Sort improvements to reduce complexity and memory.
    [(#1524)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1524)
  - Lazy IR canonicalization and LLVMIR textual generation.
    [(#1530)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1530)

* Catalyst now decomposes non-differentiable gates when in a gradient method.
  [(#1562)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1562)
  [(#1568)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1568)
  [(#1569)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1569)

  Gates that are constant, such as when all parameters are Python or NumPy data types, are not
  decomposed when this is allowable. For the adjoint differentiation method, this is allowable
  for the `StatePrep`, `BasisState`, and `QubitUnitary` operations. For the parameter-shift method,
  this is allowable for all operations.

* Changes to support a dynamic number of qubits:

  - The `qalloc_p` custom JAX primitive can now take in a dynamic number of qubits as a tracer
    and lower it to mlir.
    [(#1549)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1549)

  - `ComputationalBasisOp` can now take in a quantum register in mlir, instead of an explicit, fixed-size list of qubits.
    [(#1553)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1553)

  - Non-observable measurements without explicit wires will now compile to `ComputationalBasisOp` with a quantum register, instead of the explicit list of all qubits on the device.
  This means the same compiled IR can be reused even if the device changes its number of qubits across runs.
  This includes `probs(), state(), sample(), counts()`.
    [(#1565)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1565)

* Fixes an issue ([(#1501)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/issues/1501)) where using
  autograph in conjunction with catalyst passes causes a crash.
  [(#1541)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1541)

  [(#1576)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1576)

<h3>Internal changes ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>

* Updated the call signature for the PLXPR `qnode_prim` primitive.
  [(#1538)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1538)

* Update deprecated access to `QNode.execute_kwargs["mcm_config"]`.
  Instead `postselect_mode` and `mcm_method` should be accessed instead.
  [(#1452)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1452)

* `from_plxpr` now uses the `qml.capture.PlxprInterpreter` class for reduced code duplication.
  [(#1398)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1398)

* Improve the error message for invalid measurement in `adjoin()` or `ctrl()` region.
  [(#1425)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1425)

* Replace `ValueRange` with `ResultRange` and `Value` with `OpResult` to better align with the semantics of `**QubitResult()` functions like `getNonCtrlQubitResults()`. This change ensures clearer intent and usage. Improve the `matchAndRewrite` function by using `replaceAllUsesWith` instead of for loop.
  [(#1426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1426)

* Several changes for experimental support of trapped-ion OQD devices have been made, including:

  - The `get_c_interface` method has been added to the OQD device, which enables retrieval of the C++
    implementation of the device from Python. This allows `qjit` to accept an instance of the device
    and connect to its runtime.
    [(#1420)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1420)

  - Improved ion dialect to reduce redundant code generated. Added a string attribute `label` to Level.
    Also changed the levels of a transition from `LevelAttr` to `string`
    [(#1471)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1471)

  - The region of a `ParallelProtocolOp` is now always terminated with a `ion::YieldOp` with explicitly yielded SSA values. This ensures the op is well-formed, and improves readability.
    [(#1475)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1475)

  - Add a new pass `convert-ion-to-llvm` which lowers the Ion dialect to llvm dialect. This pass
    introduces oqd device specific stubs that will be implemented in oqd runtime including:
    `@ __catalyst__oqd__pulse`, `@ __catalyst__oqd__ParallelProtocol`.
    [(#1466)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1466)

  - The OQD device can now generate OpenAPL JSON specs during runtime. The oqd stubs
  `@ __catalyst__oqd__pulse`, and `@ __catalyst__oqd__ParallelProtocol`, which
  are called in the llvm dialect after the aforementioned lowering ([(#1466)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1466)), are defined to produce JSON specs that OpenAPL expects.
    [(#1516)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1516)

  - The OQD device is moved from `frontend/catalyst/third_party/oqd` to `runtime/lib/backend/oqd`. An overall switch, `ENABLE_OQD`, is added to control the OQD build system from a single entry point. The switch is `OFF` by default, and OQD can be built from source via `make all ENABLE_OQD=ON`, or `make runtime ENABLE_OQD=ON`.
    [(#1508)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1508)

  - Ion dialect now supports phonon modes using `ion.modes` operation.
    [(#1517)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1517)

  - Rotation angles are normalized to avoid negative duration for pulses during ion dialect lowering.
    [(#1517)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1517)

  - Catalyst now generates OpenAPL programs for Pennylane circuits of up to two qubits using the OQD device.
    [(#1517)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1517)

  - The end-to-end compilation pipeline for OQD devices is available as an API function.
    [(#1545)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1545)

* Update source code to comply with changes requested by black v25.1.0
  [(#1490)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1490)

* Revert `StaticCustomOp` in favour of adding helper functions (`isStatic()`, `getStaticParams()`
  to the `CustomOp` which preserves the same functionality. More specifically, this reverts
  [#1387] and [#1396], modifies [#1484].
  [(#1558)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1558)
  [(#1555)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1555)

* Updated the c++ standard in mlir layer from 17 to 20.
  [(#1229)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1229)
