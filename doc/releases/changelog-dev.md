# Release 0.14.0 (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Catalyst now supports Pennylane frontend operations `qml.PauliRot` and `qml.pauli_measure` 
  directly. This allows uses to write circuits in Pennylane consisting of PPR/PPMs, and 
  use the existing compilation passes in Catalyst specifically for PPR/PPMs, namely `to_ppr`, 
  `commute_ppr`, `merge_ppr_ppm`, `ppr_to_ppm`, and `ppm_compilation`.

  This is supported with both program capture enabled and disabled. However, there are several
  caveats. When program capture is disabled, we will not be able to use conditionals (i.e, 
  `qml.cond`) on the measurement result of `qml.pauli_measure`.

  To support this feature, we introduced a dummy device `catalyst.ftqc`. Users of this new 
  feature would need to set the `qnode` to use this dummy device. For example, a user can 
  now write the following circuit and have it compatible with the existing Catalyst PPR/PPM
  passes.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("catalyst.ftqc", wires=1)
  pipeline = [("pipe", ["enforce-runtime-invariants-pipeline"])]
  
  @qjit(pipelines=pipeline, target="mlir")
  @ppm_compilation
  @qml.qnode(device=dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
      qml.PauliRot(np.pi / 2, "X", wires=0)
      qml.PauliRot(np.pi / 4, "Y", wires=0)
      qml.T(wires=0)
      qml.pauli_measure("X", wires=0)
  ```

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

* The ``decompose-lowering`` MLIR pass now supports ``qml.MultiRZ``
  with an arbitrary number of wires. This decomposition is performed
  at MLIR when both capture and graph-decomposition are enabled.
  [(#2160)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2160)

* A new option ``use_nameloc`` has been added to :func:`~.qjit` that embeds variable names
  from Python into the compiler IR, which can make it easier to read when debugging programs.
  [(#2054)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2054)

* Passes registered under `qml.transform` can now take in options when used with
  :func:`~.qjit` with program capture enabled.
  [(#2154)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2154)

* Pytree inputs can now be used when program capture is enabled.

<h3>Breaking changes üíî</h3>

<h3>Deprecations üëã</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes üêõ</h3>

* Fixes the issue with capturing unutilized abstracted adjoint and controlled rules
  by the graph in the new decomposition framework.
  [(#2160)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2160)

* Fixes the translation of plxpr control flow for edge cases where the `consts` were being
  reordered.
  [(#2128)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2128)
  [(#2133)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2133)

* Fixes the translation of `QubitUnitary` and `GlobalPhase` ops
  when they are modified by adjoint or control.
  [(##2158)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2158)

* Fixes the translation of a workflow with different transforms applied to different qnodes.
  [(#2167)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2167)

<h3>Internal changes ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>

* Refactor Catalyst pass registering so that it's no longer necessary to manually add new
  passes at `registerAllCatalystPasses`.
  [(#1984)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1984)

* Split `from_plxpr.py` into two files.
  [(#2142)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2142)	

* Re-work `DataView` to avoid an axis of size 0 possibly triggering a segfault via an underflow
  error, as discovered in 
  [this comment](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1598#issuecomment-2779178046).
  [(#1621)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2164)

<h3>Documentation üìù</h3>

* A typo in the code example for :func:`~.passes.ppr_to_ppm` has been corrected.
  [(#2136)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2136)

* Fix `catalyst.qjit` and `catalyst.CompileOptions` docs rendering.
  [(#2156)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2156)
