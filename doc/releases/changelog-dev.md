# Release 0.14.0 (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* The ``decompose-lowering`` MLIR pass now supports ``qml.MultiRZ``
  with an arbitrary number of wires. This decomposition is performed
  at MLIR when both capture and graph-decomposition are enabled.
  [(#2160)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2160)

* A new option ``use_nameloc`` has been added to :func:`~.qjit` that embeds variable names
  from Python into the compiler IR, which can make it easier to read when debugging programs.
  [(#2054)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2054)

* Passes registered under `qml.transform` can now take in options when used with
  :func:`~.qjit` with program capture enabled.
  [(#2154)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2154)

* Pytree inputs can now be used when program capture is enabled.
  [(#2165)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2165)
