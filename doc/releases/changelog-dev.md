# Release 0.12.0 (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* The behaviour of measurement processes executed on `null.qubit` with QJIT is now more in line with
  their behaviour on `null.qubit` *without* QJIT.
  [(#1598)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1598)

  Previously, measurement processes like `qml.sample()`, `qml.counts()`, `qml.probs()`, etc.
  returned values from uninitialized memory when executed on `null.qubit` with QJIT. This change
  ensures that measurement processes on `null.qubit` always return the result corresponding to the
  '0' state.
