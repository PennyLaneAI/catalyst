# Release 0.15.0 (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* The default mcm_method for the finite-shots setting (dynamic one-shot) no longer silently falls
  back to single-branch statistics in most cases. Instead, an error message is raised pointing out
  alternatives, like explicitly selecting single-branch statistics.
  [(#2398)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/2398)

  Importantly, single-branch statistics only explores one branch of the MCM decision tree, meaning
  program outputs are typically probabilistic and statistics produced by measurement processes are
  conditional on the selected decision tree path.

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

<h3>Internal changes ⚙️</h3>

* The quantum dialect MLIR and TableGen source has been refactored to place type and attribute
